                "question": "How should financial institutions handle penal charges in loan accounts, and what are the key guidelines for their implementation?",
                "answer": "Penal charges for non-compliance of loan terms should be treated as such and not as penal interest. There should be no capitalization of these charges, meaning no further interest is calculated on them. However, this does not affect standard interest compounding procedures. Additionally, financial institutions must not add any extra components to the interest rate and must adhere to these guidelines. They are also required to establish a board-approved policy on penal charges, ensuring the charges are reasonable and proportionate to the non-compliance, without being discriminatory within a loan category. For loans to individual borrowers, penal charges should not exceed those for non-individual borrowers for similar non-compliance. The reasons and amounts for penal charges must be clearly communicated in the loan agreement and Key Fact Statement, and on the financial institution's website. Reminders to borrowers about non-compliance should also include the applicable penal charges. These instructions take effect from January 1, 2024, with financial institutions updating their policies and implementing the changes for new or renewed loans from that date. For existing loans, the changes should be implemented at the next review or renewal, or within six months of the effective date, whichever comes first.",
                "evaluation_criteria": "The answer should accurately define 'penal charges' and how they differ from 'penal interest'. It should include details on the prohibition of capitalization, the requirement for a board-approved policy, the need for reasonable and non-discriminatory charges, and the disclosure requirements. The answer should also specify the implementation timeline.",

Under the extant guidelines, lending institutions have the operational autonomy to formulate Board approved policy for levy of penal rates of interest. It has been observed that many REs use penal rates of interest, over and above the applicable interest rates, in case of defaults / non-compliance by the borrower with the terms on which credit facilities were sanctioned.\n\n2. The intent of levying penal interest/charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline and such charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool over and above the contracted rate of interest. However, supervisory reviews have indicated divergent practices amongst the REs with regard to levy of penal interest/charges leading to customer grievances and disputes.\n\n3. On a review of the practices followed by REs for charging penal interest/charges on loans, the following instructions are issued for adoption.\n\n(i) Penalty, if charged, for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract by the borrower shall be treated as 'penal charges' and shall not be levied in the form of 'penal interest' that is added to the rate of interest charged on the advances. There shall be no capitalisation of penal charges i.e., no further interest computed on such charges. However, this will not affect the normal procedures for compounding of interest in the loan account.\n\n(ii) The REs shall not introduce any additional component to the rate of interest and ensure compliance to these guidelines in both letter and spirit.\n\n(iii) The REs shall formulate a Board approved policy on penal charges or similar charges on loans, by whatever name called.\n\n(iv) The quantum of penal charges shall be reasonable and commensurate with the noncompliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminatory within a particular loan / product category.\n\n(v) The penal charges in case of loans sanctioned to 'individual borrowers, for purposes other than business', shall not be higher than the penal charges applicable to nonindividual borrowers for similar non-compliance of material terms and conditions.\n\n(vi) The quantum and reason for penal charges shall be clearly disclosed by REs to the customers in the loan agreement and most important terms & conditions / Key Fact Statement (KFS) as applicable, in addition to being displayed on REs website under Interest rates and Service Charges.\n\n(vii) Whenever reminders for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan are sent to borrowers, the applicable penal charges shall be communicated. Further, any instance of levy of penal charges and the reason therefor shall also be communicated.\n\n(viii) These instructions shall come into effect from January 1, 2024. REs may carry out appropriate revisions in their policy framework and ensure implementation of the instructions in respect of all the fresh loans availed/ renewed from the effective date. In the case of existing loans, the switchover to new penal charges regime shall be ensured on next review or renewal date or six months from the effective date of this circular, whichever is earlier.\n\n4. The above instructions are issued under sections 21, 35A and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 and shall be updated in the relevant Master Directions / Master Circulars of the applicable REs. The list of amendments to the Master Directions / Master Circulars has been provided in the [Annex.](#page-3-0)\n\n5. These instructions shall, however, not apply to Credit Cards, External Commercial Borrowings, Trade Credits and Structured Obligations which are covered under product specific directions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Santosh Kumar Panigrahy) Chief General Manager\n\nEncl: As above\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>\n\n\n\n\nC.

The revised regulatory framework for IDF-NBFCs is provided in the **[Annex.](#page-1-0)** These guidelines shall come into effect from the date of this circular.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(J.P. Sharma) Chief General Manager\n\n#### **Annex**\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>An IDF is set up either as a trust or as a company. A trust based IDF is registered as an IDF-Mutual Fund (IDF-MF) and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) whereas a company based IDF is registered as an IDF-NBFC and is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\n#### **2. Definition**\n\nAn IDF-NBFC means a non-deposit taking NBFC which is permitted to \u2013 (i) refinance post commencement operations date (COD) infrastructure projects that have completed at least one year of satisfactory commercial operations; and (ii) finance toll operate transfer (TOT) projects as the direct lender.\n\n#### **3. Net owned funds (NOF) and regulatory capital**\n\nAn IDF-NBFC shall be required to have an NOF of at least \u20b9300 crore and capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of minimum 15 per cent (with minimum Tier 1 capital of 10 per cent).\n\n## **4. Raising of funds**\n\n- (i) IDF-NBFC shall raise funds through issue of either rupee or dollar denominated bonds of minimum five-year maturity. With a view to facilitate better asset-liability management (ALM), IDF-NBFCs can raise funds through shorter tenor bonds and commercial papers (CPs) from the domestic market to the extent of up to 10 per cent of their total outstanding borrowings.\n- (ii) In addition to the bond route, IDF-NBFCs can also raise funds through loan route under external commercial borrowings (ECBs). However, such borrowings shall be subject to minimum tenor of five years and the ECB loans should not be sourced from foreign branches of Indian banks.\n- (iii) Regarding ECBs, IDF-NBFCs shall also be required to adhere to the guidelines issued by the Foreign Exchange Department of the RBI.\n\n# **5. Exposure limits**\n\nThe exposure limits for IDF-NBFCs shall be 30% of their Tier 1 capital for single borrower/ party and 50% of their Tier 1 capital for single group of borrowers/ parties.\n\n### **6. Risk weights**\n\nFor computing CRAR of the IDF-NBFCs, their assets shall be risk-weighted as per riskweights applicable to NBFC-Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICCs).\n\n# **7. Requirements of a sponsor and tripartite agreement**\n\n7.1 Under the earlier guidelines, an IDF-NBFC was required to be sponsored by a bank or an NBFC-Infrastructure Finance Company (NBFC-IFC). The requirement of a sponsor for an IDF-NBFC has now been withdrawn and shareholders of IDF-NBFCs shall be subjected to scrutiny as applicable to other NBFCs, including NBFC-IFCs.\n\n7.2 Earlier, IDF-NBFCs were required to enter into a tripartite agreement with the concessionaire and the project authority for investments in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects having a project authority. The requirement of the tripartite agreement has now been made optional.\n\n#### **8. Other regulatory norms**\n\nAll other regulatory norms including income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms as applicable to NBFC-ICCs shall be applicable to IDF-NBFCs.\n\n# **9. Guidelines governing sponsorship of IDF-MFs by NBFCs**\n\n9.1 All NBFCs shall be eligible to sponsor (sponsorship as defined by SEBI Regulations for Mutual Funds) IDF-MFs with prior approval of the RBI subject to the following conditions (based on the audited financial statements), in addition to those prescribed by SEBI:\n\n- (i) The NBFC shall have a minimum NOF of \u20b9300 crore and CRAR of 15 percent;\n- (ii) Its net NPAs shall be less than 3 per cent of the net advances;\n- (iii) It shall have been in existence for at least 5 years;\n- (iv)It shall be earning profits for the last three years and its performance shall be satisfactory;\n- (v) The CRAR of the NBFC post investment in the IDF-MF shall not be less than the regulatory minimum prescribed for it;\n- (vi)The NBFC shall continue to maintain the required level of NOF after accounting for investment in the proposed IDF-MF;\n- (vii) There shall be no supervisory concerns with respect to the NBFC.\n\n9.2 NBFCs that fulfil the eligibility criteria as above shall approach the Department of Regulation of the RBI, for prior approval to sponsor IDF-MFs.",
