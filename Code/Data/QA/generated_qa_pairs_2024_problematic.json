As a measure to assist the account holders and with a view to consolidating and rationalising the extant instructions on inoperative accounts, a review was carried out in consultation with all stakeholders.

These instructions (provided in the [Annex\\)](#page-1-0) are expected to complement the ongoing efforts and initiatives taken by banks and the Reserve Bank, to reduce the quantum of unclaimed deposits in the banking system and return such deposits to their rightful owners/ claimants.\n\n3.

Review of Accounts**\n\n2.1 Banks shall undertake atleast an annual review in respect of accounts, where there is no customer induced transactions for more than a year. In cases where there is no explicit mandate to renew the term deposit, the banks should review such accounts if the customers have not withdrawn the proceeds after maturity or transferred these to their savings/current account in order to prevent such deposits from becoming unclaimed. The banks shall inform the account/deposit holders in writing through letters or email or SMS (if the email and mobile number are registered with the bank) that there has been no operation in their accounts/deposits in the last one year, as the case may be. The alert messages shall invariably mention that the account would become 'inoperative' if no operations are carried out during the next one year and, the account holder would be required to submit KYC documents afresh for reactivating the account in such case.\n\n2.2 If the letters are returned undelivered or no response is received through registered email, the bank shall immediately undertake an enquiry to find out the whereabouts of account holder or his/her nominee/legal heirs in case the account holder is deceased.\n\n2.3. In case any response is received from the account holder giving the reasons for not operating the account, the banks shall continue to classify the account as operative for one more year and the account holder shall be advised to operate the account within a period of one year (herein after referred to as 'extended period'). In case the account holder still fails to operate the account within the extended period, the banks shall classify the said account as inoperative account after the expiry of the extended period.\n\n2.4 For the purpose of classifying an account as 'inoperative', only customer induced transactions and not bank induced transactions shall be considered. There may be instances where the customer has given a mandate like Standing Instructions (SI)/ auto-renewal instructions and there are no other operations in the Savings /Current account or the Term Deposit. These transactions shall also be treated as customer induced transactions.\n\n2.5 The classification of an account as inoperative shall be for a particular account of the customer and not with reference to the customer. In case a customer is maintaining multiple accounts/deposits with a bank, all such accounts/deposits shall be assessed individually for the purpose of classifying them as inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit, as the case may be.\n\n2.6 In case the account holder is not carrying out transaction and the account is inoperative due to shifting of primary account to another bank, the account holder may be requested to provide the details of the new bank account with authorisation to enable the bank to transfer the balance from the existing bank account.\n\n### **3. Treatment of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and credit of Direct Benefit Transfer under Government Schemes**\n\nThe banks open zero balance accounts for beneficiaries of Central/State government schemes and for students who receive scholarship. Central and State governments have been expressing difficulty in crediting cheques/Direct Benefit Transfer/ Electronic Benefit Transfer/ scholarship amount in these accounts as they are also classified as inoperative due to non-operation for two years. The banks shall, based on the purpose of opening of the account, segregate the aforementioned accounts in their CBS, so that the stipulation of 'inoperative' account is not applicable to these accounts due to their non-operation for a period of more than two years. To avoid the risk of fraud, etc., in such accounts, while allowing operations in these accounts, the bank should exercise due diligence as per the extant instructions.\n\n# **4. Segregation and Audit of Inoperative Accounts/ Unclaimed Deposits**\n\n4.1 The segregation of inoperative accounts is required to be done to reduce the risk of frauds. The transactions in inoperative accounts, which have been reactivated, shall be monitored regularly, for at least six months, at higher levels (i.e. by controlling authorities of the concerned branch) without the knowledge and notice of the customers and the dealing staff.\n\n4.2 The banks shall ensure that amounts lying in inoperative accounts/unclaimed deposits and reactivated inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits, are subjected to concurrent audit.\n\n## **5. Tracing of Customers of Inoperative Accounts/ Unclaimed Deposits**\n\n5.1 The bank shall contact the holder(s) of the inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit through letters, email or SMS (i",

The banks shall also contact the nominee, if registered, for tracing the customer.\n\n5.3 The banks shall undertake special drives periodically to find out the whereabouts of the customers, their nominees or legal heirs in respect of inoperative accounts / unclaimed deposits.\n\n## **PART II- OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES**\n\n#### **6. Activation of Inoperative Accounts**\n\n6.1 The banks shall make available the facility of updation of KYC for activation of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits at all branches (including non-home branches) and through Video-Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) if requested by the account holder, subject to the facility of V-CIP being provided by the bank. The V-CIP related instructions under Master Direction - [Know Your Customer \\(KYC\\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566)  [Direction, 2016 dated February 25, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) (as updated from time to time) shall be adhered to by the bank.\n\n6.2 The banks shall activate the inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits, including those which are under freeze by orders of various agencies like Courts, Tribunals, Law Enforcement Agencies, only after adhering to the KYC guidelines provided in the Master Direction - [Know Your Customer \\(KYC\\) Direction, 2016 dated February 25,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566)  [2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) (as updated from time to time) such as Customer Due Diligence (CDD), customer identification, risk categorisation, etc.\n\n6.3 The banks shall ensure that activation of inoperative account/ unclaimed deposits in CBS necessarily requires second level of authorisation by another officer at the same or higher level (i.e., through maker and checker). System logs shall invariably be maintained in case of any activity in or activation of inoperative accounts/unclaimed deposits for concurrent audit purpose. The preservation period of such system logs shall be as per the internal guidelines of the bank.\n\n6.4 The bank shall automatically intimate the inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit holders though SMS and registered email stating that on the basis of the KYC documents submitted by them, the inoperative status of the account has been removed. The intimation shall also mention the remedial measures available to them to report unauthorised access, if any. This would alert the account/ unclaimed deposit holder against any possible fraudulent activity in his/her inoperative account. The banks shall have in place adequate operational safeguards to ensure that the claimants in case of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits are genuine. The banks shall process requests for activation of inoperative account/ unclaimed deposits within three working days from the receipt of the complete application.\n\n## **7. Payment of Interest**\n\nInterest on savings accounts shall be credited on a regular basis irrespective of the fact that the account is in operation or not.\n\n#### **8. Levy of Charges**\n\n8.1 The banks are not permitted to levy penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balances in any account that is classified as an inoperative account.\n\n8.2 No charges shall be levied for activation of inoperative accounts.\n\n# **9. Display of Unclaimed Deposits and Search Facility**\n\nBanks shall host the details of unclaimed deposits {only name, address (without pin code) and Unclaimed Deposit Reference Number (UDRN)}, which have been transferred to DEA Fund of RBI on their respective websites, which shall be updated regularly, at least on a monthly basis. The banks, which do not have their own websites shall make available the above list of unclaimed deposits in their respective branches. The database hosted on the website shall provide a search option to enable the public to search for their unclaimed deposits using name in combination with the address of the account holder/ entity. Upon a successful search, details of unclaimed deposits shall be displayed in a format comprising account holder's name(s), his/her address (without pincode) and UDRN only. In case such accounts are not in the name of individuals, the search input and result should include names of individuals authorised to operate the accounts. However, the account number, its type, outstanding balance and the name of the branch shall not be disclosed on the bank's website.\n\n### **10.

The guidelines on Large Exposures Framework (LEF) are applicable to NBFC-Upper Layer (NBFC-UL) in terms of paragraph 110 of the MD on NBFC. The NBFC-Base Layer (NBFC-BL) and NBFC-Middle Layer (NBFC-ML) are, however, governed by the credit/investment concentration norms prescribed at paragraphs 32 and 91 of the MD on NBFC, paragraph 20 of MD on HFC an[d circular on Scale Based Regulation](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0)  (SBR): [A Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0) October 22, 2021. In order to ensure uniformity and consistency in computation of concentration norms among NBFCs, a review of the extant concentration norms has been carried out and it has been decided as under:\n\n### **A. Regulations for NBFC-ML**\n\n## **3. Computation of exposure – Credit Risk Transfer Instruments**\n\nAggregate exposure to a counterparty comprising both on and off-balance sheet exposures are calculated based on the method prescribed for capital computation in MD on NBFC and MD on HFC; i.e., on-balance sheet exposures are reckoned at the outstanding amount[1](#page-1-0) while the off-balance sheet exposures are converted into credit risk equivalent by applying the credit conversion factor prescribed under capital requirements. Further, as per Annex XIV of the MD on NBFC, credit default swaps (CDS) are currently allowed as credit risk transfer instruments for offsetting exposure to the underlying counterparty. Henceforth, the exposures of NBFC-ML shall also be offset with credit risk transfer instruments listed below:\n\n- a. Cash margin/caution money/security deposit held as collateral on behalf of the borrower against the advances for which right to set off is available;\n- b. Central Government guaranteed claims which attract 0 per cent risk weight for capital computation;\n- c. State Government guaranteed claims which attract 20 per cent risk weight for capital computation[2](#page-1-1);\n- d. Guarantees issued under the Credit Guarantee Schemes of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH) and individual schemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) subject to meeting the conditions of [circular on 'Review of Prudential Norms –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0) Risk [Weights for Exposures guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Schemes \\(CGS\\)'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0)  [dated September 07, 2022,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0) as amended from time to time.\n\nProvided that to be eligible as a credit risk transfer instrument, guarantees shall be direct, explicit, irrevocable and unconditional.\n\n#### **4. Exemptions from credit/investment concentration norms**\n\nIn addition to the exposures already exempted from credit/investment concentration norms in terms of paragraph 91 of MD on NBFC and paragraph 20 of MD on HFC, exposures listed below shall also be exempt from credit/investment concentration norms:\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> Netting is allowed only for assets where provisions for depreciation or for bad and doubtful debts have been made.\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span><sup>2</sup> To the extent of State Government guarantee used for offsetting exposures by NBFC-ML, the exposure shall shift to the State Government with applicable risk weight of 20%. No cap has been fixed for shifting of exposure on the State Government.\n\n- a. Exposure to the Government of India and State Governments which are eligible for zero percent risk weight under capital regulations applicable to NBFC[3;](#page-2-0)\n- b.

The updated Master Circular consolidates all the instructions / guidelines on the subject issued till date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n \n\n(Vaibhav Chaturvedi) Chief General Manager\n\nEncl: As above\n\n\n\n## **Master Circular on Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions – UCBs**\n\n## <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>**1. General**\n\n1.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) have been advised to fix limits on their exposure -\n\n- (i) to individual borrowers and group borrowers;\n- (ii) to specific sectors; and,\n- (iii) towards unsecured advances.\n\n1.2 In addition, these banks are also required to observe certain statutory and regulatory restrictions in respect of:\n\n- (i) advances against shares, debentures and bonds;\n- (ii) investments in shares, debentures and bonds.\n\n1.3 Currently operative instructions on all these aspects are detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\n## <span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>**2. Definitions**\n\n## 2.1 Tier-I Capital\n\nTier-I capital as on March 31 of the preceding financial year shall be reckoned for the purpose of fixing the exposure limits. Tier-I capital for the purpose will be the same as that prescribed for computation of capital adequacy of UCBs (vide [Master Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490)  [dated April 20, 2023 on Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy\\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490), as amended from time to time.\n\n2.2 Exposure shall include both credit exposure (Loans and Advances) and investment exposure (Non- SLR securities) as indicated below.\n\n## 2.3 Credit Exposure\n\n#### 2.3.1 Credit exposure shall include -\n\n(a) funded and non-funded credit limits and underwriting and similar commitments;\n\n(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing and hire purchase financing; and,\n\n(c) ad hoc limits sanctioned to the borrowers to meet the contingencies.\n\n2.3.2 Credit exposure shall not include loans and advances granted against the security of bank's own term deposits.\n\n2.3.3 The sanctioned limit or outstanding whichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at credit exposure limit. Further, in case of fully drawn term loans, where there is no scope of re-drawal of any portion of the sanctioned limit, banks may reckon the outstanding for arriving at credit exposure limit.\n\n2.3.4 In respect of non-funded credit limit, 100 per cent of such limit or outstanding, whichever is higher, need be taken into account for the purpose.\n\n2.3.5 The level of individual bank's share in Consortium / Multiple Banking / Syndication shall be governed by single borrower / group exposure.\n\n## 2.4 Investment Exposure (Non-SLR securities)\n\nUCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Chapter VII of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [on 'Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) dated April [1, 2023,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) as updated from time to time.\n\n#### 2.5 Group\n\n2.5.1 The decision in regard to definition of a group is left to the perception of the UCBs, which are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele. The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs may, therefore, be decided by the UCBs on the basis of relevant information available with them, the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management and effective control.\n\n2.5.2 The different firms with one or more common partners engaged in the same line of business, *viz*., manufacturing, processing, trading activity, etc. shall be deemed to be connected group and units coming under common ownership shall be deemed to be a single party.\n\n#### 2.6 Unsecured advances\n\nUnsecured advances shall include clean overdrafts, loans against personal security, clean bills or *Multani hundies* purchased or discounted, cheques purchased and drawals allowed against cheques sent for collection but shall exclude:\n\n(i) advances backed by guarantee of the central or state governments, public sector financial institutions, banks and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation;\n\n(ii) advances again",

The Board of the bank may fix a lower amount within the ceiling limit of ₹30 lakh per annum depending upon the size of the bank, experience of the NED and other relevant factors.\n\n4. As hitherto, private sector banks would be required to obtain regulatory approval regarding remuneration to Part-time Chairman in terms of Section 10B(1A)(i) and 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n\n5. Banks are required to make disclosure on remuneration paid to the directors on an annual basis at a minimum, in their Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## **Applicability and Commencement**\n\n6.

Currently, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Immediate Payments Service (IMPS) systems enable a remitter to verify the name of the beneficiary before initiating transfer. It has been decided to put in place a similar facility that would enable a remitter to verify the beneficiary bank account name before initiating a transaction using RTGS or NEFT system. Accordingly, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has been advised to develop the facility and onboard all banks.\n\n3. Banks which are participants of RTGS and NEFT Systems, shall make this facility available to their customers through Internet banking and Mobile banking. The facility shall also be available to remitters visiting branches for making transactions. Detailed requirements for the same are provided in the **[Annex](#page-2-0)**.\n\n4. All banks who are direct members or sub members of RTGS and NEFT are advised to offer this facility no later than April 1, 2025.\n\n5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sudhanshu Prasad) Chief General Manager\n\n## **Annex**\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>(CO.DPSS.RPPD.No.S987/04.03.001/2024-25 dated December 30, 2024)\n\n## **Introduction of beneficiary bank account name look-up facility for Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) Systems**\n\n- 1. To ensure that remitters using RTGS and NEFT systems can verify the name of the bank account to which money is being transferred before initiating the transfer and thereby avoid mistakes and prevent frauds, a solution for fetching the beneficiary's name is being implemented. Based on the account number and IFSC of the beneficiary entered by the remitter, the facility will fetch the beneficiary's account name from the bank's Core Banking Solution (CBS).\n- 2. This facility shall be made available to remitters through Internet banking and Mobile banking. The facility shall also be available to remitters visiting branches for making transactions.\n- 3. To ensure uniform experience for customers, the banks shall adhere to the instructions given below:\n\t- i. Provision to verify beneficiary bank account name shall be provided in Internet banking and Mobile banking facilities at the time of registering a beneficiary and at the time of one-time fund transfer where the beneficiary may not be registered.\n\t- ii. Provision to re-verify a registered beneficiary at any time shall also be provided.\n\t- iii. Beneficiary account name provided by the beneficiary bank shall be displayed to the remitter.\n\t- iv. In case the beneficiary name cannot be displayed for any reason, the remitter can proceed with the fund transfer, at her discretion.\n\t- v. Specific alert messages as provided in the technical document, issued earlier by NPCI, shall be displayed to the remitter.\n- 4. Both remitting and beneficiary banks shall preserve detailed logs of all queries made, responses received and all other activities as part of beneficiary bank account name lookup facility.\n- 5. NPCI shall not store any data relating to this facility. In case of a dispute, the remitting bank and the beneficiary bank shall resolve the dispute based on the unique lookup reference number and the corresponding logs.\n- 6. While providing the facility, banks shall ensure to comply with legal provisions related to data privacy, if any.\n- 7. Beneficiary account name lookup facility shall be made available to customers without any charge.\n- 8. All banks who are direct members or sub members of RTGS and NEFT are advised to offer this facility no later than April 1, 2025.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",

Paragraph 10 – Customer Acceptance Policy**\n\nParagraph 10(f) of the Master Direction is amended to read as follows: REs shall apply the CDD procedure at the UCIC level. Thus, if an existing KYC compliant customer of a RE desires to open another account or avail any other product or service from the same RE, there shall be no need for a fresh CDD exercise as far as identification of the customer is concerned.\n\n#### **II. Paragraph 37**\n\nThe 'Explanation' that \"*High risk accounts have to be subjected to more intensified monitoring*\" is applicable to sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 37 and accordingly, the 'Explanation' has been shifted.\n\n#### **III. Paragraph 38 - Updation/ Periodic Updation of KYC**\n\nTo provide better clarity, the phrase 'updation' has been inserted with the phrase 'periodic updation' in the clauses (ii) and (iv) of sub-paragraph (a); and clauses (iii) and (iv) of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 38.\n\n# **IV. Paragraph 56 - CDD Procedure and sharing KYC information with Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR)**\n\nParagraph 56(h) of the Master Direction is amended to read as follows**:**\n\nIn order to ensure that all KYC records are incrementally uploaded on to CKYCR, REs shall upload/update the KYC data pertaining to accounts of individual customers and LEs opened prior to the above-mentioned dates as per clauses (e) and (f), respectively, at the time of periodic updation as specified in paragraph 38 of this Master Direction, or earlier, when the updated KYC information is obtained/received from the customer. Also, whenever the RE obtains additional or updated information from any customer as per clause (j) below in this paragraph or Rule 9(1C) of the PML Rules, the RE shall within seven days or within such period as may be notified by the Central Government, furnish the updated information to CKYCR, which shall update the KYC records of the existing customer in CKYCR. CKYCR shall thereafter inform electronically all the reporting entities who have dealt with the concerned customer regarding updation of KYC record of the said customer. Once CKYCR informs an RE regarding an update in the KYC record of\n\nan existing customer, the RE shall retrieve the updated KYC records from CKYCR and update the KYC record maintained by the RE.\n\nParagraph 56(j) of the Master Direction is amended to read as follows**:**\n\nFor the purpose of establishing an account-based relationship, updation/ periodic updation or for verification of identity of a customer, the RE shall seek the KYC Identifier from the customer or retrieve the KYC Identifier, if available, from the CKYCR and proceed to obtain KYC records online by using such KYC Identifier and shall not require a customer to submit the same KYC records or information or any other additional identification documents or details,",

It requires banks, among other things, to undertake an annual review of accounts/ deposits where there are no customer induced transactions for more than a year; segregation in their Core Banking Solution of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and/ or Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)/ Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) under Government Schemes to facilitate credit of DBTs even if such accounts have become inoperative; and take steps to trace the customers of these accounts/ deposits. It also contains operational guidelines for activation of such accounts/ deposits, customer awareness measures such as public awareness and financial literacy campaigns to be undertaken by banks and requires information on the process for activation of such accounts/ deposits to be displayed on the banks' websites and branches.\n\n2. The Department of Supervision, RBI, recently conducted an analysis, which revealed that the number of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits in several banks was on the higher side vis-a-vis their total deposits as well as in absolute terms. The reasons were attributed to either inactivity for a long time or pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC in such accounts. Reportedly, there were instances of customers facing inconvenience when they approached the bank branches for activation of inoperative accounts including inadvertent errors in customer details such as mismatch in name, etc. It was also observed that a few banks have a large pendency of accounts that are due for updation/ periodic updation of KYC, resulting in such accounts getting frozen for further transactions as per bank's internal policies.\n\n> पयर्वेक्षण िवभाग, के �ीय कायार्लय, मेकर टावर - एफ़, कफ परेड, कोलाबा, मुंबई - 400 005 टेलीफोन: 022 - 6997 3817 ई-मेल: [ppgdos@rbi.org.in](mailto:ppgdos@rbi.org.in)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n3. The banks are, therefore, advised to take necessary steps urgently to bring down the number of inoperative/ frozen accounts and make the process of activation of such accounts smoother and hassle free, including by enabling seamless updation of KYC through mobile/internet banking, non-home branches, Video Customer Identification Process, etc. While the accounts of beneficiaries of various Central/ State government schemes like DBT/EBT etc., are required to be segregated to facilitate uninterrupted credit of such DBT/EBT amounts in their accounts, instances have been observed where the accounts of such beneficiaries have been frozen due to other factors such as pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC. Since these accounts mostly pertain to the people from the underprivileged sections of the society, the banks may facilitate the process of activation of accounts by taking an empathetic view in such cases. The banks may also organise special campaigns for facilitating activation of inoperative/ frozen accounts. Besides, the banks may also facilitate Aadhaar updation for customers through the branches providing Aadhaar related services. Instructions have been issued separately to SLBCs to proactively monitor the situation in their respective jurisdictions with a view to minimise customer inconvenience.\n\n4. The progress in reduction of inoperative/ frozen accounts and the special efforts made by the banks in this regard, may be monitored by the Customer Service Committee (CSC) of the Board. In addition, the banks are also advised to report the same on a quarterly basis to the respective Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM) through DAKSH portal, starting from the quarter ending December 31, 2024.\n\n5. A copy of this Circular shall also be placed before the CSC of the Board in its next meeting along with a monitorable action plan for ensuring full compliance in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh) Chief General Manager",

Section 17(1) of CICRA mandates that CICs can collect credit information from its member CIs or member CICs only. Therefore, only the entities that are covered under the ambit of section 2(f) of CICRA, 2005 can submit credit information to CICs.\n\n2.

In such cases, repayment history of borrowers of these entities is not updated even if these borrowers continue to repay/ clear their dues.\n\n3. In order to redress the hardship faced by such borrowers, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (vii) of section 2(f) and sub-section (1) of section 11 of CICRA, the Reserve Bank of India directs CICs and CIs to implement a credit information reporting mechanism subsequent to the cancellation of the licence/CoR of banks/ Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) as given in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n4.

Accordingly, the revised framework replacing the SAF, under the nomenclature Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework is contained in the enclosed [Annex.](#page-2-0)\n\n3. The PCA Framework shall be applicable to all UCBs under Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories except UCBs under All Inclusive Directions[1.](#page-0-0) Tier 1 UCBs, though not covered under the PCA Framework as of now, shall be subject to enhanced monitoring under the extant supervisory framework. The exemption of Tier 1 UCBs from the PCA Framework shall be reviewed in due course.\n\n4.

Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability will be the key areas for monitoring in the revised PCA Framework.\n- B. Indicators to be tracked for Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability would be CRAR, Net NPA Ratio (percentage of net NPA to net advances) and net profit, respectively.\n- C. The PCA Framework would apply to all Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4, based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators.\n- D. Breach of any risk threshold (as detailed under) may result in invocation of PCA.\n\n\n\\* For Tier 2 to 4 UCBs as per the glide path provided for achieving the regulatory minimum CRAR of 12% by March 31, 2026.\n\n<span id=\"page-2-1\"></span><sup>2</sup> Reserve Bank of India - [Press Releases \\(rbi.org.in\\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=54059)\n\n![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n- E. A bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Reported/Audited Annual Financial Results and/or the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. However, RBI may impose PCA on any bank during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant. Although supervisory action taken will primarily be based on the criteria specified under the PCA Framework, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking appropriate supervisory action in case stress is noticed in other important indicators/parameters or in case of serious governance issues. Also, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking any supervisory action other than those indicated in this circular, based on the merits of each case.\n- F.

It is observed that some UCBs have created the Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) through appropriation of profits, with an intent to utilise these balances to pay dividend in future years, when profits are not sufficient or where the bank has posted a net loss. However, extant guidelines on [\"Declaration of Dividends by UCBs\" dated July 05, 2012](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=7426&Mode=0) *ibid* prohibit dividend payments from previously accumulated profits or reserves and mandate that dividend can only be paid by the banks from net profit of the current year after making all statutory and other provisions and after adjustment for accumulated losses in full. It is also observed that UCBs have been considering the balances in DEF as part of Tier-II capital.\n\n3. In order to provide a better treatment of these balances for regulatory capital purposes, it has been decided, as a onetime measure, to permit UCBs to transfer the balances in the DEF to general reserves/free reserves. The credit balances in general reserves/free reserves, shall qualify as Tier-I capital as per our Master Circular *ibid.*\n\n> िविनयमन िवभाग,क� �ीय कायार्लय, 12 व� और 13 व� मंिजल, क��ीय कायार्लय भवन, शहीद भगत �संह मागर्,फोटर्,मुंबई-400001 दूरभाष: 022-22601000 फै क्स: 022-22705691 ई-मेल: [cgmicdor@rbi.org.in](mailto:cgmicdor@rbi.org.in)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Department of Regulation, Central Office, 12th and 13th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai-400 001 Tel: 022- 2260 1000 Fax: 022-2270 5691 email[: cgmicdor@rbi.org.in](mailto:cgmicdor@rbi.org.in)\n\n�हंदी आसान है इसका �योग बढ़ाइए\n\n4.

While in some cases, BDDR is created by recognising an expense in the Profit and Loss (P&L) Account, in other cases it is created through appropriations from net profits.\n\n2. In terms of Accounting Standard (AS) 5[2,](#page-0-1) all expenses which are recognised in a period should be included in the determination of net profit or loss for the period. Consequently, not recognising the required provisions for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) as an expense while arriving at the net profit in the P&L Account is not in consonance with extant Accounting Standards. Further, the treatment of BDDR for regulatory capital and reckoning of net NPAs varies across banks and in many cases has been observed to be at variance with regulatory norms.\n\n3. Accordingly, with a view to bringing about uniformity in the treatment of BDDR for prudential purposes, revised instructions on BDDR are being issued, as under:\n\na) With effect from the FY 2024-25, all provisions as per Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms[3](#page-0-2), whether accounted for\n\nिविनयमन िवभाग,क� �ीय कायार्लय, 12 व� और 13 व� मंिजल, क��ीय कायार्लय भवन, शहीद भगत �संह मागर्,फोटर्,मुंबई-400001 दूरभाष: 022-22601000 फै क्स: 022-22705691 ई-मेल: cgmicdor@rbi.org.in\n\n <sup>1</sup> BDDR, in the context of this circular, also includes reserves with such similar terminology.\n\n<span id=\"page-0-1\"></span><span id=\"page-0-0\"></span><sup>2</sup> AS 5 - Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items and Changes in Accounting Policies.\n\n<span id=\"page-0-2\"></span><sup>3</sup> Urban Co-operative Banks may refer to the [Master Circular DOR.STR.REC.9/21.04.048/2024-25](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12658) dated April 02, [2024](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12658) titled 'Income Recognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and Other Related Matters – UCBs' (as amended from time to time) and State and Central Co-operative Banks may refer to guidelines issued by NABARD on the IRACP norms (as amended from time to time).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Department of Regulation, Central Office, 12th and 13th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai- 400 001 Tel: 022- 2260 1000 Fax: 022-2270 5691 email: cgmicdor@rbi.org.in\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nunder the head \"BDDR\" or any other head of account, shall be charged as an expense to the P&L account in the accounting period in which they are recognised.

Such provisions shall be permitted to be netted off from GNPAs to arrive at NNPAs.\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span> <sup>4</sup> Urban Co-operative Banks may refer to the [Master Circular DOR.CAP.REC.5/09.18.201/2024-25](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12654) dated April 01, [2024](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12654) titled 'Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy - Primary (Urban) Co-operat",

In terms of extant instructions, Full Fledged Money Changers (FFMCs)/non-bank Authorised Dealers (ADs) Category-II may obtain their normal business requirements of foreign currency notes from other FFMCs and Authorised Dealers (ADs) in India. Further, they are also required to keep balances in foreign currencies at reasonable levels to avoid buildup of idle balances.\n\n3. In this regard, it has been decided that from July 1, 2024, value of foreign currency notes sold by FFMCs / non-bank ADs Category -II to the public for permitted purposes should not be less than 75% of the value of foreign currency notes purchased from other FFMCs/ ADs, on a quarterly basis. Data of such sale and purchase should be maintained and made available for audit / inspection. FFMCs/ADs selling foreign currency may also ascertain the 'sale to public' requirement of the buying FFMCs/non-bank ADs Category II, by seeking relevant data from such entities.\n\n4. Further, it has also been decided that FFMCs/non-bank ADs Category-II shall submit their annual audited balance sheet to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank along with a certificate from their statutory auditors regarding the NOF as on the date of the balance sheet, latest by October 31 of the year concerned.\n\n5. The directions contained in this circular have been issued under Section 10(4) and Section 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and are without prejudice to permissions/approvals, if any, required under any other law.\n\n6.

The following paras of the Directions stand amended in view of factors detailed thereunder.\n\n### 2. **Para 7 - Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement:**\n\nThe MD specifies that the lists of districts with comparatively high and low PSL credit detailed in Annex IA and IB of the MD are valid until FY 2023-24 subject to review thereafter. Based on a review, the lists of districts have been updated. These lists will remain valid until FY 2026-27 and will be reviewed thereafter. Accordingly, from FY 2024-25 onwards, a higher weight (125%) would be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) would be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). Therefore, [para 7 of the](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#Adjustments)  [MD on PSL](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#Adjustments) has been updated as mentioned above.\n\n## 3. **Para 9 - Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises:**\n\nThe definition of MSMEs has been referenced to the [Master Direction](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11060) - Lending to [Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises \\(MSME\\) Sector,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11060) for clarity.\n\nिव�ीय समावेशन और िवकास िवभाग,क� �ीय कायार्लय, 10व� मंिज़ल,क� �ीय कायार्लय िब�ल्डंग,शहीद भगत �संह मागर्, मुंबई 400 001 टेलीफोन:Tel No.: +912222601000/ फै क्स: +91-22-22621011/22610948/22610943 ईमेल: [cgmincfidd@rbi.org.in](mailto:cgmincfidd@rbi.org.in) Financial Inclusion and Development Department, Central Office,10th Flr, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg,Mumbai 400001\n\n�हंदी आसान है, इसका �योग बढ़ाइए\n\nचेतावनी **:** �रज़वर् ब�क �ारा -डाक, मेल एसएमएस या फोन कॉल के ज�रए �कसी क� भी व् यि�गत जानकारी जैसे ब�क के खाते का ब् यौरा, पासवडर् आ�द नह� मांगी जाती है। यह धन रखने या देने का �स् ताव भी नह� करता है। ऐसे �स् ताव� का �कसी भी तरीके से जवाब मत दीिजए। **Caution: RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes calls asking for personal information like bank account details, passwords, etc. It never keeps or offers funds to anyone.

This provision has been repealed in terms of Master Direction - [Reserve Bank of India \\(Filing of Supervisory Returns\\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12613)  Directions – [2024 \\(MD on FSR\\) dated February 27, 2024.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12613) The applicable return for reporting PSL data by UCBs has been prescribed at Sl.

Since the transfer of regulation of HFCs from National Housing Bank (NHB) to Reserve Bank with effect from August 09, 2019, various regulations have been issued treating HFCs as a category of NBFCs. To be consistent with this policy stance and as stated in para 4 of the aforementioned circular, an analysis of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs was undertaken, with an objective of harmonising these regulations, duly considering specialised nature of the HFCs.\n\n3. Accordingly, based on a review of the extant regulations applicable to HFCs prescribed vide Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) Housing [Finance Company \\(Reserve Bank\\) Directions, 2021,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) it has been decided to issue revised regulations as detailed in the [Part A of](#page-2-0) **Annex**. As part of the exercise, certain\n\nregulations applicable to NBFCs have also been reviewed and revised regulations are detailed in [Part B of](#page-10-0) **Annex**. The revised regulations shall be applicable with effect from January 01, 2025.\n\n4.

P. Sharma) Chief General Manager\n\n# **Part A**\n\n# **Section I: Guidelines regarding Acceptance of Public Deposits** *(applicable only to HFCs holding CoR to accept/ hold public deposits)*\n\n1. Currently, HFCs accepting public deposits are subject to more relaxed prudential parameters on deposit acceptance as compared to NBFCs. Since the regulatory concerns associated with deposit acceptance are same across all categories of NBFCs, it has been decided to move HFCs towards the regulatory regime on deposit acceptance as applicable to deposit-taking NBFCs and specify uniform prudential parameters as prescribed under Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Companies](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563)  [Acceptance of Public Deposits \\(Reserve Bank\\) Directions, 2016.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563) Accordingly, the revised regulations as stated in subsequent paragraphs would be applicable to HFCs accepting or holding public deposits.\n\n## **Maintenance of a minimum percentage of liquid assets**\n\n2. Currently, in terms of Section 29B of the NHB Act, 1987, deposit taking HFCs are required to maintain 13 per cent liquid assets against public deposits held by them. In exercise of powers conferred under Section 29B of NHB Act, 1987, it has now been decided that all deposit taking HFCs shall maintain, on an ongoing basis, liquid assets to the extent of 15 per cent of the public deposits held by them, in a phased manner as specified below:\n\n\n# **Safe Custody of Liquid Assets**\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>\n\n3. Deposit taking HFCs are required to maintain liquid assets under Section 29B of NHB Act and such liquid assets shall be entrusted for safe custody with specified entities as stated in para 40 of Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030)\n\n[Housing Finance Company \\(Reserve Bank\\) Directions, 2021.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) It has been decided that the regulations on safe custody of liqui",

However, this clause will not be insisted upon if the transactions are pre-funded i.e., either clear INR\n\n�व�नयमन �वभाग, क�द्र�य कायार्लय, क�द्र�य कायार्लय भवन, 12वीं/ 13वींमंिज़ल, शह�द भगत �स ंह मागर्, फोटर्, मुंबई - 400001 टेल�फोन/ Tel No: 22661602, 22601000 फै क्स/ Fax No: 022-2270 5691\n\nDepartment of Regulation, Central Office, Central Office Building, 12th/ 13th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai – 400001\n\nfunds are available in the customer's account or, in case of FX deals, the bank's nostro account has been credited before the issuance of the IPC.\n\n- ii) The maximum intraday risk to the custodian banks issuing IPCs would be reckoned as Capital Market Exposure (CME) at 30 percent of the settlement amount. This is based on the assumption of 20 percent downward price movement of the equities on T+1, with an additional margin of 10 percent for further downward movement of price.\n- iii) In case margin is paid in cash, the exposure will stand reduced by the amount of margin paid. In case margin is paid by way of permitted securities to Mutual Funds / Foreign Portfolio Investors, the exposure will stand reduced by the amount of margin after adjusting for haircut as prescribed by the Exchange on the permitted securities accepted as margin.\n- iv) Under T+1 settlement cycle, the exposure shall normally be for intraday. However, in case any exposure remains outstanding at the end of T+1 Indian Standard Time, capital will have to be maintained on the outstanding capital market exposure in terms of the Master Circular – [Basel III Capital Regulations](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12652)  [dated April 1, 2024,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12652) as amended from time to time.\n- v) The underlying exposures of banks to their counterparties, emanating from the intraday CME, will be subject to limits prescribed under [Large Exposure](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11573&Mode=0)  [Framework dated June 3, 2019,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11573&Mode=0) as amended from time to time.\n\n3.

This is being done in order to enhance transparency and reduce information asymmetry on financial products being offered by different regulated entities, thereby empowering borrowers for making an informed financial decision. The harmonised instructions shall be applicable in cases of all retail and MSME term loan products extended by all regulated entities (REs).\n\n- 3. For the purpose of this circular, following terms have been defined:\n\t- (a) **Key Facts** of a loan agreement between an RE/a group of REs and a borrower are legally significant and deterministic facts that satisfy basic information required to assist the borrower in taking an informed financial decision.\n\t- (b) **Key Facts Statement (KFS)** is a statement of key facts of a loan agreement, in simple and easier to understand language, provided to the borrower in a standardised format.\n- (c) **Annual Percentage Rate (APR**) is the annual cost of credit to the borrower which includes interest rate and all other charges associated with the credit facility.\n- (d) **Equated Periodic Instalment (EPI)** is an equated or fixed amount of repayments, consisting of both the principal and interest components, to be paid by a borrower towards repayment of a loan at periodic intervals for a fixed number of such intervals; and which result in complete amortisation of the loan. EPIs at monthly intervals are called EMIs.\n\nOther words and expressions not defined above, but used in this circular, shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under the [Master Direction on Interest Rate](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10295)  [on Advances \\(2016\\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10295) as updated from time to time or any other relevant regulation issued by the Reserve Bank.\n\n4. REs shall provide a KFS to all prospective borrowers to help them take an informed view before executing the loan contract, as per the standardised format given in the **[Annex A](#page-4-0)**. The KFS shall be written in a language understood by such borrowers. Contents of KFS shall be explained to the borrower and an acknowledgement shall be obtained that he/she has understood the same.\n\n5. Further, the KFS shall be provided with a unique proposal number and shall have a validity period of at least three working days for loans having tenor of seven days or more, and a validity period of one working day for loans having tenor of less than seven days.[1](#page-1-0)\n\n# *Explanation*\n\nValidity period refers to the period available to the borrower, after being provided the KFS by the RE, to agree to the terms of the loan. The RE shall be bound by the terms of the loan indicated in the KFS, if agreed to by the borrower during the validity period.\n\n6.
