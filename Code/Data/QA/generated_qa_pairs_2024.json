As a measure to assist the account holders and with a view to consolidating and rationalising the extant instructions on inoperative accounts, a review was carried out in consultation with all stakeholders. Based on the review, it has been decided to issue comprehensive guidelines on the measures to be put in place by the banks covering various aspects of classifying accounts and deposits as inoperative accounts and unclaimed deposits, as the case may be, periodic review of such accounts and deposits, measures to prevent fraud in such accounts/deposits, grievance redressal mechanism for expeditious resolution of complaints, steps to be taken for tracing the customers of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits including their nominees/ legal heirs for re-activation of accounts, settlement of claims or closure and the process to be followed by them. These instructions (provided in the [Annex\\)](#page-1-0) are expected to complement the ongoing efforts and initiatives taken by banks and the Reserve Bank, to reduce the quantum of unclaimed deposits in the banking system and return such deposits to their rightful owners/ claimants.\n\n3.

Review of Accounts**\n\n2.1 Banks shall undertake atleast an annual review in respect of accounts, where there is no customer induced transactions for more than a year. In cases where there is no explicit mandate to renew the term deposit, the banks should review such accounts if the customers have not withdrawn the proceeds after maturity or transferred these to their savings/current account in order to prevent such deposits from becoming unclaimed. The banks shall inform the account/deposit holders in writing through letters or email or SMS (if the email and mobile number are registered with the bank) that there has been no operation in their accounts/deposits in the last one year, as the case may be. The alert messages shall invariably mention that the account would become 'inoperative' if no operations are carried out during the next one year and, the account holder would be required to submit KYC documents afresh for reactivating the account in such case.\n\n2.2 If the letters are returned undelivered or no response is received through registered email, the bank shall immediately undertake an enquiry to find out the whereabouts of account holder or his/her nominee/legal heirs in case the account holder is deceased.\n\n2.3. In case any response is received from the account holder giving the reasons for not operating the account, the banks shall continue to classify the account as operative for one more year and the account holder shall be advised to operate the account within a period of one year (herein after referred to as 'extended period'). In case the account holder still fails to operate the account within the extended period, the banks shall classify the said account as inoperative account after the expiry of the extended period.\n\n2.4 For the purpose of classifying an account as 'inoperative', only customer induced transactions and not bank induced transactions shall be considered. There may be instances where the customer has given a mandate like Standing Instructions (SI)/ auto-renewal instructions and there are no other operations in the Savings /Current account or the Term Deposit. These transactions shall also be treated as customer induced transactions.\n\n2.5 The classification of an account as inoperative shall be for a particular account of the customer and not with reference to the customer. In case a customer is maintaining multiple accounts/deposits with a bank, all such accounts/deposits shall be assessed individually for the purpose of classifying them as inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit, as the case may be.\n\n2.6 In case the account holder is not carrying out transaction and the account is inoperative due to shifting of primary account to another bank, the account holder may be requested to provide the details of the new bank account with authorisation to enable the bank to transfer the balance from the existing bank account.\n\n### **3. Treatment of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and credit of Direct Benefit Transfer under Government Schemes**\n\nThe banks open zero balance accounts for beneficiaries of Central/State government schemes and for students who receive scholarship. Central and State governments have been expressing difficulty in crediting cheques/Direct Benefit Transfer/ Electronic Benefit Transfer/ scholarship amount in these accounts as they are also classified as inoperative due to non-operation for two years. The banks shall, based on the purpose of opening of the account, segregate the aforementioned accounts in their CBS, so that the stipulation of 'inoperative' account is not applicable to these accounts due to their non-operation for a period of more than two years. To avoid the risk of fraud, etc., in such accounts, while allowing operations in these accounts, the bank should exercise due diligence as per the extant instructions.\n\n# **4. Segregation and Audit of Inoperative Accounts/ Unclaimed Deposits**\n\n4.1 The segregation of inoperative accounts is required to be done to reduce the risk of frauds. The transactions in inoperative accounts, which have been reactivated, shall be monitored regularly, for at least six months, at higher levels (i.e. by controlling authorities of the concerned branch) without the knowledge and notice of the customers and the dealing staff.\n\n4.2 The banks shall ensure that amounts lying in inoperative accounts/unclaimed deposits and reactivated inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits, are subjected to concurrent audit.\n\n## **5. Tracing of Customers of Inoperative Accounts/ Unclaimed Deposits**\n\n5.1 The bank shall contact the holder(s) of the inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit through letters, email or SMS (i",

The guidelines on Large Exposures Framework (LEF) are applicable to NBFC-Upper Layer (NBFC-UL) in terms of paragraph 110 of the MD on NBFC. The NBFC-Base Layer (NBFC-BL) and NBFC-Middle Layer (NBFC-ML) are, however, governed by the credit/investment concentration norms prescribed at paragraphs 32 and 91 of the MD on NBFC, paragraph 20 of MD on HFC an[d circular on Scale Based Regulation](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0)  (SBR): [A Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0) October 22, 2021. In order to ensure uniformity and consistency in computation of concentration norms among NBFCs, a review of the extant concentration norms has been carried out and it has been decided as under:\n\n### **A. Regulations for NBFC-ML**\n\n## **3. Computation of exposure \u2013 Credit Risk Transfer Instruments**\n\nAggregate exposure to a counterparty comprising both on and off-balance sheet exposures are calculated based on the method prescribed for capital computation in MD on NBFC and MD on HFC; i.e., on-balance sheet exposures are reckoned at the outstanding amount[1](#page-1-0) while the off-balance sheet exposures are converted into credit risk equivalent by applying the credit conversion factor prescribed under capital requirements. Further, as per Annex XIV of the MD on NBFC, credit default swaps (CDS) are currently allowed as credit risk transfer instruments for offsetting exposure to the underlying counterparty. Henceforth, the exposures of NBFC-ML shall also be offset with credit risk transfer instruments listed below:\n\n- a. Cash margin/caution money/security deposit held as collateral on behalf of the borrower against the advances for which right to set off is available;\n- b. Central Government guaranteed claims which attract 0 per cent risk weight for capital computation;\n- c. State Government guaranteed claims which attract 20 per cent risk weight for capital computation[2](#page-1-1);\n- d. Guarantees issued under the Credit Guarantee Schemes of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH) and individual schemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) subject to meeting the conditions of [circular on 'Review of Prudential Norms \u2013](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0) Risk [Weights for Exposures guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Schemes \\(CGS\\)'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0)  [dated September 07, 2022,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0) as amended from time to time.\n\nProvided that to be eligible as a credit risk transfer instrument, guarantees shall be direct, explicit, irrevocable and unconditional.\n\n#### **4. Exemptions from credit/investment concentration norms**\n\nIn addition to the exposures already exempted from credit/investment concentration norms in terms of paragraph 91 of MD on NBFC and paragraph 20 of MD on HFC, exposures listed below shall also be exempt from credit/investment concentration norms:\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> Netting is allowed only for assets where provisions for depreciation or for bad and doubtful debts have been made.\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span><sup>2</sup> To the extent of State Government guarantee used for offsetting exposures by NBFC-ML, the exposure shall shift to the State Government with applicable risk weight of 20%.

However, any such request for removal shall be forwarded to RBI with the approval of the Board / ACB.\n\n7.2 An auditor / audit firm shall not be eligible for appointment / re-appointment in the same bank for six years (two tenures) immediately after completion of a full or part tenure. In case an auditor / audit firm has conducted audit of the bank for part-tenure (one year or two years) and then is not re-appointed for the remainder tenure, it shall not be eligible for re-appointment in the same bank for six years after completion of part-tenure. However, audit firms can continue to undertake statutory audit of other banks.\n\n# **8. Number of StCBs / CCBs an Audit firm can Audit**\n\n8.1 An audit firm can concurrently take up statutory audit of a maximum of **five** banks (**including not more than one StCB**) in a year.\n\n8.2 The limit of five banks will be in addition to the limit of 20 Regulated Entities (REs), as prescribed in the 'Guidelines for Appointment of Statutory Central Auditors (SCAs) / Statutory Auditors (SAs) of Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), UCBs and NBFCs (including HFCs)' dated April 27, 2021.\n\n8.3 Further, in a year, an audit firm **cannot** simultaneously take up statutory audit of both StCB and CCBs operating in the same State.\n\n8.4 In other words, an audit firm can concurrently take up statutory audit of a maximum of four Commercial Banks [including not more than one PSB or one All India Financial Institution (NABARD, SIDBI, NaBFID, NHB, EXIM Bank) or RBI], eight Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), eight Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and five StCBs / CCBs (including not more than one StCB) in a year.\n\n8.5 This limit is subject to the audit firm's compliance with the eligibility criteria and other conditions as prescribed in these guidelines and within the overall ceiling prescribed by any other statute or rules.\n\n8.6 For the purpose of these guidelines, a group of audit firms having common partner(s) and / or under the same network shall be considered as one unit and considered for appointment as SA accordingly. The incoming audit firm shall not be eligible if such an audit firm is associated with the outgoing audit firm or is under the same network of audit firms.\n\n8.7 Share",

The updated Master Circular consolidates all the instructions / guidelines on the subject issued till date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n \n\n(Vaibhav Chaturvedi) Chief General Manager\n\nEncl: As above\n\n\n\n## **Master Circular on Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions \u2013 UCBs**\n\n## <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>**1. General**\n\n1.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) have been advised to fix limits on their exposure -\n\n- (i) to individual borrowers and group borrowers;\n- (ii) to specific sectors; and,\n- (iii) towards unsecured advances.\n\n1.2 In addition, these banks are also required to observe certain statutory and regulatory restrictions in respect of:\n\n- (i) advances against shares, debentures and bonds;\n- (ii) investments in shares, debentures and bonds.\n\n1.3 Currently operative instructions on all these aspects are detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\n## <span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>**2. Definitions**\n\n## 2.1 Tier-I Capital\n\nTier-I capital as on March 31 of the preceding financial year shall be reckoned for the purpose of fixing the exposure limits. Tier-I capital for the purpose will be the same as that prescribed for computation of capital adequacy of UCBs (vide [Master Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490)  [dated April 20, 2023 on Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy\\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490), as amended from time to time.\n\n2.2 Exposure shall include both credit exposure (Loans and Advances) and investment exposure (Non- SLR securities) as indicated below.\n\n## 2.3 Credit Exposure\n\n#### 2.3.1 Credit exposure shall include -\n\n(a) funded and non-funded credit limits and underwriting and similar commitments;\n\n(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing and hire purchase financing; and,\n\n(c) ad hoc limits sanctioned to the borrowers to meet the contingencies.\n\n2.3.2 Credit exposure shall not include loans and advances granted against the security of bank's own term deposits.\n\n2.3.3 The sanctioned limit or outstanding whichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at credit exposure limit. Further, in case of fully drawn term loans, where there is no scope of re-drawal of any portion of the sanctioned limit, banks may reckon the outstanding for arriving at credit exposure limit.\n\n2.3.4 In respect of non-funded credit limit, 100 per cent of such limit or outstanding, whichever is higher, need be taken into account for the purpose.\n\n2.3.5 The level of individual bank's share in Consortium / Multiple Banking / Syndication shall be governed by single borrower / group exposure.\n\n## 2.4 Investment Exposure (Non-SLR securities)\n\nUCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Chapter VII of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [on 'Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) dated April [1, 2023,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) as updated from time to time.\n\n#### 2.5 Group\n\n2.5.1 The decision in regard to definition of a group is left to the perception of the UCBs, which are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele. The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs may, therefore, be decided by the UCBs on the basis of relevant information available with them, the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management and effective control.\n\n2.5.2 The different firms with one or more common partners engaged in the same line of business, *viz*., manufacturing, processing, trading activity, etc. shall be deemed to be connected group and units coming under common ownership shall be deemed to be a single party.\n\n#### 2.6 Unsecured advances\n\nUnsecured advances shall include clean overdrafts, loans against personal security, clean bills or *Multani hundies* purchased or discounted, cheques purchased and drawals allowed against cheques sent for collection but shall exclude:\n\n(i) advances backed by guarantee of the central or state governments, public sector financial institutions, banks and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation;\n\n(ii) advances again",

Exposure Norms**\n\n<span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>3.1 Exposure Ceiling to Individual / Group Borrowers\n\n3.1.1 UCBs are required to fix, with the approval of their Board of Directors, exposure ceiling in relation to their Tier-I capital. The exposure for the purpose shall comprise both credit exposure (loans and advances) and investment exposure (Non-SLR securities) as detailed at Para 2.3 and 2.4 so that -\n\n(i) the exposure to an individual borrower does not exceed 15 per cent of Tier-I capital; and,\n\n(ii) the exposure to a group of connected borrowers/parties does not exceed 25 per cent of Tier-I capital.\n\n3.1.2 The exposure limits prescribed in Para 3.1.1 apply to all types of fresh exposures taken by UCBs after March 13, 2020 and UCBs were required to bring down their exposures which were in excess of the revised limits to within the aforesaid revised limits by March 31, 2023. However, where the existing exposure comprises only term loans and non-fund-based facilities, while no further exposure shall be taken on such borrowers, these facilities may be allowed to continue as per their respective repayment schedule / till maturity.\n\n3.1.3 Whether borrowers / parties belong to a 'group of connected borrowers / parties' shall be determined based on the instructions contained at Para 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above.\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>3.2 Computation of exposure ceiling for individual / group borrowers\n\nThe exercise of computing the exposure ceilings may be conducted every year after the finalisation and audit of balance sheet of the bank and the exposure ceilings may be advised to the loan sanctioning authorities and the investment department in the bank. In view of the linking of shareholding to lending, accretion to or reduction in the share capital after the balance sheet date, may be taken into account for determining exposure ceiling at half-yearly intervals, with the approval of their Board of Directors. Accordingly, banks may, if they so desire, fix a fresh exposure limit taking into account the amount of share capital available as on 30th September. However, accretion to capital funds other than to share capital, such as half-yearly profit etc., will not be eligible for reckoning the exposure ceiling. Banks should also ensure that they do not take exposures in excess of ceiling prescribed in anticipation of infusion of capital on a future date.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-5-1\"></span>3.3 Thresholds for value of loans\n\nUCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than \u20b925 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier-I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of \u20b91 crore, per borrower / party. Tier-I capital for this purpose shall be reckoned in the manner provided in paragraph 2.1 above. Notwithstanding the above, UCBs shall adhere to the exposure limits stipulated at Para 3.1 above. UCBs which do not, at present, comply with the prescribed threshold shall be in conformity with the above requirements by March 31, 2024. It is clarified that 'loans' for the purpose shall include all types of funded and non-funded exposures in the nature of credit.\n\n<span id=\"page-5-2\"></span>3.4 Exposure to Housing, Real Estate and Commercial ",

Therefore, **banks should not finance NBFCs, other than those engaged in hire-purchase / leasing**.\n\n(ii) Similarly, admission of non-banking financial companies which are **not engaged exclusively** in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the state cooperative societies act concerned and model bylaw No. 9. It will, therefore, be necessary for the UCBs to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting such leasing / hire purchase companies as members.\n\n6.8.2 Activities eligible for finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities\n\nWithin the prescribed credit exposure norms and above stated restrictions, UCBs, with working capital funds aggregating to \u20b925 crores and above, may finance the NBFC - Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICC), subject to the following limits:\n\n\n#### Note\n\n(i) The maximum limit on bank finance should be within the overall ceiling of borrowing by NBFCs, upto ten times of their NOF.\n\n(ii) Bank finance to leasing concerns should be restricted only to \"full payout\" leases i.e., those leases where the cost of the asset is fully recovered during the primary lease period itself and further it should cover purchases of only new equipment.\n\n(iii) As a prudent policy, lease rentals due during the period of next five years should alone be taken into account for the purpose of lending.\n\n6.8.3 Activities not Eligible for Finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities\n\n6.8.3.1 The following activities undertaken by non-banking financial companies engaged in hire purchase / leasing activities are not eligible for bank credit. As such, these items should be excluded from the build-up of current assets while arriving at permissible bank finance for all categories of NBFCs :\n\n(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except where specifically permitted;\n\n(ii) Investments made in shares, debentures etc. of a current nature, i.e., stockin-trade;\n\n(iii) Investment in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other entities; and,\n\n(iv) Investments in and inter-corporate loans / deposits to other companies.\n\n6.8.3.2 In respect of items indicated at (a) and (b) above, banks should not make any adjustment in the projected net working capital (NWC). It may be added that the projected NWC represents long-term surplus available to support current operations and, therefore, does not need to be adjusted as a result of changing / pruning the level of current assets while reducing the level of maximum permissible bank finance.\n\n6.8.4 Financing of NBFCs by Scheduled UCBs\n\n6.8.4.1 Scheduled UCBs may rediscount bills discounted by NBFCs arising from sale of commercial vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to normal lending safeguards and the following conditions:\n\n(i) the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturers on dealers only;\n\n(ii) the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from the chassis / engine numbers; and,\n\n(iii) before rediscounting the bills, the UCBs should satisfy themselves about the bona- fides and track record of NBFCs which have discounted the bills.\n\n6.8.4.2 Scheduled UCBs may provide finance to NBFCs eligible for bank finance for the purpose of on lending to Small Road and Water Transport Operators (SRWTOs) for purchase of trucks and classify such advances under priority sector, provided the ultimate borrowers (SRWTOs) satisfy the eligibility requirements for being classified under the priority sector.\n\n6.8.4.3 UCBs may finance NBFCs for on-lending to individual farmers and for hire purchase schemes for distribution of agricultural machinery and implements and the same may be reckoned for the purpose of priority sector lending as indirect finance to agriculture.\n\n6.8.4.4 The Scheduled UCBs may extend finance to NBFCs or other financial intermediaries for on-lending to small and micro enterprises (manufacturing as well as service) and classify such finance under priority sector after satisfying that relevant norms at the ultimate borrowal level are complied with.\n\n<span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>6.9 Financing Equipment Leasing and Hire Purchase Financing\n\nConsequent to the Government of India notification dated December 12, 1995 specifying 'Hire Purchase' and 'Equipment Leasing' as forms of business in which it is lawful for a primary cooperative bank to engage, Scheduled UCBs are allowed to",

Proof in this regard may be called for only in cases where banks have reason to doubt the borrowers' declaration. Even where a proof is required, it is not necessary to insist on a certificate from the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner; production of a receipt evidencing the payment of the dues or a certificate from the auditors of the borrower or any other similar proof may be considered sufficient.
