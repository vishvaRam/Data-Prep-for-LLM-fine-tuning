As a measure to assist the account holders and with a view to consolidating and rationalising the extant instructions on inoperative accounts, a review was carried out in consultation with all stakeholders. Based on the review, it has been decided to issue comprehensive guidelines on the measures to be put in place by the banks covering various aspects of classifying accounts and deposits as inoperative accounts and unclaimed deposits, as the case may be, periodic review of such accounts and deposits, measures to prevent fraud in such accounts/deposits, grievance redressal mechanism for expeditious resolution of complaints, steps to be taken for tracing the customers of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits including their nominees/ legal heirs for re-activation of accounts, settlement of claims or closure and the process to be followed by them. These instructions (provided in the [Annex\\)](#page-1-0) are expected to complement the ongoing efforts and initiatives taken by banks and the Reserve Bank, to reduce the quantum of unclaimed deposits in the banking system and return such deposits to their rightful owners/ claimants.\n\n3.

Review of Accounts**\n\n2.1 Banks shall undertake atleast an annual review in respect of accounts, where there is no customer induced transactions for more than a year. In cases where there is no explicit mandate to renew the term deposit, the banks should review such accounts if the customers have not withdrawn the proceeds after maturity or transferred these to their savings/current account in order to prevent such deposits from becoming unclaimed. The banks shall inform the account/deposit holders in writing through letters or email or SMS (if the email and mobile number are registered with the bank) that there has been no operation in their accounts/deposits in the last one year, as the case may be. The alert messages shall invariably mention that the account would become 'inoperative' if no operations are carried out during the next one year and, the account holder would be required to submit KYC documents afresh for reactivating the account in such case.\n\n2.2 If the letters are returned undelivered or no response is received through registered email, the bank shall immediately undertake an enquiry to find out the whereabouts of account holder or his/her nominee/legal heirs in case the account holder is deceased.\n\n2.3. In case any response is received from the account holder giving the reasons for not operating the account, the banks shall continue to classify the account as operative for one more year and the account holder shall be advised to operate the account within a period of one year (herein after referred to as 'extended period'). In case the account holder still fails to operate the account within the extended period, the banks shall classify the said account as inoperative account after the expiry of the extended period.\n\n2.4 For the purpose of classifying an account as 'inoperative', only customer induced transactions and not bank induced transactions shall be considered. There may be instances where the customer has given a mandate like Standing Instructions (SI)/ auto-renewal instructions and there are no other operations in the Savings /Current account or the Term Deposit. These transactions shall also be treated as customer induced transactions.\n\n2.5 The classification of an account as inoperative shall be for a particular account of the customer and not with reference to the customer. In case a customer is maintaining multiple accounts/deposits with a bank, all such accounts/deposits shall be assessed individually for the purpose of classifying them as inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit, as the case may be.\n\n2.6 In case the account holder is not carrying out transaction and the account is inoperative due to shifting of primary account to another bank, the account holder may be requested to provide the details of the new bank account with authorisation to enable the bank to transfer the balance from the existing bank account.\n\n### **3. Treatment of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and credit of Direct Benefit Transfer under Government Schemes**\n\nThe banks open zero balance accounts for beneficiaries of Central/State government schemes and for students who receive scholarship. Central and State governments have been expressing difficulty in crediting cheques/Direct Benefit Transfer/ Electronic Benefit Transfer/ scholarship amount in these accounts as they are also classified as inoperative due to non-operation for two years. The banks shall, based on the purpose of opening of the account, segregate the aforementioned accounts in their CBS, so that the stipulation of 'inoperative' account is not applicable to these accounts due to their non-operation for a period of more than two years. To avoid the risk of fraud, etc., in such accounts, while allowing operations in these accounts, the bank should exercise due diligence as per the extant instructions.\n\n# **4. Segregation and Audit of Inoperative Accounts/ Unclaimed Deposits**\n\n4.1 The segregation of inoperative accounts is required to be done to reduce the risk of frauds. The transactions in inoperative accounts, which have been reactivated, shall be monitored regularly, for at least six months, at higher levels (i.e. by controlling authorities of the concerned branch) without the knowledge and notice of the customers and the dealing staff.\n\n4.2 The banks shall ensure that amounts lying in inoperative accounts/unclaimed deposits and reactivated inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits, are subjected to concurrent audit.\n\n## **5. Tracing of Customers of Inoperative Accounts/ Unclaimed Deposits**\n\n5.1 The bank shall contact the holder(s) of the inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit through letters, email or SMS (i",

The guidelines on Large Exposures Framework (LEF) are applicable to NBFC-Upper Layer (NBFC-UL) in terms of paragraph 110 of the MD on NBFC. The NBFC-Base Layer (NBFC-BL) and NBFC-Middle Layer (NBFC-ML) are, however, governed by the credit/investment concentration norms prescribed at paragraphs 32 and 91 of the MD on NBFC, paragraph 20 of MD on HFC an[d circular on Scale Based Regulation](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0)  (SBR): [A Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0) October 22, 2021. In order to ensure uniformity and consistency in computation of concentration norms among NBFCs, a review of the extant concentration norms has been carried out and it has been decided as under:\n\n### **A. Regulations for NBFC-ML**\n\n## **3. Computation of exposure \u2013 Credit Risk Transfer Instruments**\n\nAggregate exposure to a counterparty comprising both on and off-balance sheet exposures are calculated based on the method prescribed for capital computation in MD on NBFC and MD on HFC; i.e., on-balance sheet exposures are reckoned at the outstanding amount[1](#page-1-0) while the off-balance sheet exposures are converted into credit risk equivalent by applying the credit conversion factor prescribed under capital requirements. Further, as per Annex XIV of the MD on NBFC, credit default swaps (CDS) are currently allowed as credit risk transfer instruments for offsetting exposure to the underlying counterparty. Henceforth, the exposures of NBFC-ML shall also be offset with credit risk transfer instruments listed below:\n\n- a. Cash margin/caution money/security deposit held as collateral on behalf of the borrower against the advances for which right to set off is available;\n- b. Central Government guaranteed claims which attract 0 per cent risk weight for capital computation;\n- c. State Government guaranteed claims which attract 20 per cent risk weight for capital computation[2](#page-1-1);\n- d. Guarantees issued under the Credit Guarantee Schemes of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH) and individual schemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) subject to meeting the conditions of [circular on 'Review of Prudential Norms \u2013](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0) Risk [Weights for Exposures guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Schemes \\(CGS\\)'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0)  [dated September 07, 2022,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12384&Mode=0) as amended from time to time.\n\nProvided that to be eligible as a credit risk transfer instrument, guarantees shall be direct, explicit, irrevocable and unconditional.\n\n#### **4. Exemptions from credit/investment concentration norms**\n\nIn addition to the exposures already exempted from credit/investment concentration norms in terms of paragraph 91 of MD on NBFC and paragraph 20 of MD on HFC, exposures listed below shall also be exempt from credit/investment concentration norms:\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> Netting is allowed only for assets where provisions for depreciation or for bad and doubtful debts have been made.\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span><sup>2</sup> To the extent of State Government guarantee used for offsetting exposures by NBFC-ML, the exposure shall shift to the State Government with applicable risk weight of 20%.

However, any such request for removal shall be forwarded to RBI with the approval of the Board / ACB.\n\n7.2 An auditor / audit firm shall not be eligible for appointment / re-appointment in the same bank for six years (two tenures) immediately after completion of a full or part tenure. In case an auditor / audit firm has conducted audit of the bank for part-tenure (one year or two years) and then is not re-appointed for the remainder tenure, it shall not be eligible for re-appointment in the same bank for six years after completion of part-tenure. However, audit firms can continue to undertake statutory audit of other banks.\n\n# **8. Number of StCBs / CCBs an Audit firm can Audit**\n\n8.1 An audit firm can concurrently take up statutory audit of a maximum of **five** banks (**including not more than one StCB**) in a year.\n\n8.2 The limit of five banks will be in addition to the limit of 20 Regulated Entities (REs), as prescribed in the 'Guidelines for Appointment of Statutory Central Auditors (SCAs) / Statutory Auditors (SAs) of Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), UCBs and NBFCs (including HFCs)' dated April 27, 2021.\n\n8.3 Further, in a year, an audit firm **cannot** simultaneously take up statutory audit of both StCB and CCBs operating in the same State.\n\n8.4 In other words, an audit firm can concurrently take up statutory audit of a maximum of four Commercial Banks [including not more than one PSB or one All India Financial Institution (NABARD, SIDBI, NaBFID, NHB, EXIM Bank) or RBI], eight Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), eight Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and five StCBs / CCBs (including not more than one StCB) in a year.\n\n8.5 This limit is subject to the audit firm's compliance with the eligibility criteria and other conditions as prescribed in these guidelines and within the overall ceiling prescribed by any other statute or rules.\n\n8.6 For the purpose of these guidelines, a group of audit firms having common partner(s) and / or under the same network shall be considered as one unit and considered for appointment as SA accordingly. The incoming audit firm shall not be eligible if such an audit firm is associated with the outgoing audit firm or is under the same network of audit firms.\n\n8.7 Share",

The updated Master Circular consolidates all the instructions / guidelines on the subject issued till date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n \n\n(Vaibhav Chaturvedi) Chief General Manager\n\nEncl: As above\n\n\n\n## **Master Circular on Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions \u2013 UCBs**\n\n## <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>**1. General**\n\n1.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) have been advised to fix limits on their exposure -\n\n- (i) to individual borrowers and group borrowers;\n- (ii) to specific sectors; and,\n- (iii) towards unsecured advances.\n\n1.2 In addition, these banks are also required to observe certain statutory and regulatory restrictions in respect of:\n\n- (i) advances against shares, debentures and bonds;\n- (ii) investments in shares, debentures and bonds.\n\n1.3 Currently operative instructions on all these aspects are detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\n## <span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>**2. Definitions**\n\n## 2.1 Tier-I Capital\n\nTier-I capital as on March 31 of the preceding financial year shall be reckoned for the purpose of fixing the exposure limits. Tier-I capital for the purpose will be the same as that prescribed for computation of capital adequacy of UCBs (vide [Master Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490)  [dated April 20, 2023 on Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy\\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490), as amended from time to time.\n\n2.2 Exposure shall include both credit exposure (Loans and Advances) and investment exposure (Non- SLR securities) as indicated below.\n\n## 2.3 Credit Exposure\n\n#### 2.3.1 Credit exposure shall include -\n\n(a) funded and non-funded credit limits and underwriting and similar commitments;\n\n(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing and hire purchase financing; and,\n\n(c) ad hoc limits sanctioned to the borrowers to meet the contingencies.\n\n2.3.2 Credit exposure shall not include loans and advances granted against the security of bank's own term deposits.\n\n2.3.3 The sanctioned limit or outstanding whichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at credit exposure limit. Further, in case of fully drawn term loans, where there is no scope of re-drawal of any portion of the sanctioned limit, banks may reckon the outstanding for arriving at credit exposure limit.\n\n2.3.4 In respect of non-funded credit limit, 100 per cent of such limit or outstanding, whichever is higher, need be taken into account for the purpose.\n\n2.3.5 The level of individual bank's share in Consortium / Multiple Banking / Syndication shall be governed by single borrower / group exposure.\n\n## 2.4 Investment Exposure (Non-SLR securities)\n\nUCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Chapter VII of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [on 'Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) dated April [1, 2023,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) as updated from time to time.\n\n#### 2.5 Group\n\n2.5.1 The decision in regard to definition of a group is left to the perception of the UCBs, which are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele. The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs may, therefore, be decided by the UCBs on the basis of relevant information available with them, the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management and effective control.\n\n2.5.2 The different firms with one or more common partners engaged in the same line of business, *viz*., manufacturing, processing, trading activity, etc. shall be deemed to be connected group and units coming under common ownership shall be deemed to be a single party.\n\n#### 2.6 Unsecured advances\n\nUnsecured advances shall include clean overdrafts, loans against personal security, clean bills or *Multani hundies* purchased or discounted, cheques purchased and drawals allowed against cheques sent for collection but shall exclude:\n\n(i) advances backed by guarantee of the central or state governments, public sector financial institutions, banks and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation;\n\n(ii) advances again",

Exposure Norms**\n\n<span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>3.1 Exposure Ceiling to Individual / Group Borrowers\n\n3.1.1 UCBs are required to fix, with the approval of their Board of Directors, exposure ceiling in relation to their Tier-I capital. The exposure for the purpose shall comprise both credit exposure (loans and advances) and investment exposure (Non-SLR securities) as detailed at Para 2.3 and 2.4 so that -\n\n(i) the exposure to an individual borrower does not exceed 15 per cent of Tier-I capital; and,\n\n(ii) the exposure to a group of connected borrowers/parties does not exceed 25 per cent of Tier-I capital.\n\n3.1.2 The exposure limits prescribed in Para 3.1.1 apply to all types of fresh exposures taken by UCBs after March 13, 2020 and UCBs were required to bring down their exposures which were in excess of the revised limits to within the aforesaid revised limits by March 31, 2023. However, where the existing exposure comprises only term loans and non-fund-based facilities, while no further exposure shall be taken on such borrowers, these facilities may be allowed to continue as per their respective repayment schedule / till maturity.\n\n3.1.3 Whether borrowers / parties belong to a 'group of connected borrowers / parties' shall be determined based on the instructions contained at Para 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above.\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>3.2 Computation of exposure ceiling for individual / group borrowers\n\nThe exercise of computing the exposure ceilings may be conducted every year after the finalisation and audit of balance sheet of the bank and the exposure ceilings may be advised to the loan sanctioning authorities and the investment department in the bank. In view of the linking of shareholding to lending, accretion to or reduction in the share capital after the balance sheet date, may be taken into account for determining exposure ceiling at half-yearly intervals, with the approval of their Board of Directors. Accordingly, banks may, if they so desire, fix a fresh exposure limit taking into account the amount of share capital available as on 30th September. However, accretion to capital funds other than to share capital, such as half-yearly profit etc., will not be eligible for reckoning the exposure ceiling. Banks should also ensure that they do not take exposures in excess of ceiling prescribed in anticipation of infusion of capital on a future date.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-5-1\"></span>3.3 Thresholds for value of loans\n\nUCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than \u20b925 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier-I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of \u20b91 crore, per borrower / party. Tier-I capital for this purpose shall be reckoned in the manner provided in paragraph 2.1 above. Notwithstanding the above, UCBs shall adhere to the exposure limits stipulated at Para 3.1 above. UCBs which do not, at present, comply with the prescribed threshold shall be in conformity with the above requirements by March 31, 2024. It is clarified that 'loans' for the purpose shall include all types of funded and non-funded exposures in the nature of credit.\n\n<span id=\"page-5-2\"></span>3.4 Exposure to Housing, Real Estate and Commercial ",

Therefore, **banks should not finance NBFCs, other than those engaged in hire-purchase / leasing**.\n\n(ii) Similarly, admission of non-banking financial companies which are **not engaged exclusively** in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the state cooperative societies act concerned and model bylaw No. 9. It will, therefore, be necessary for the UCBs to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting such leasing / hire purchase companies as members.\n\n6.8.2 Activities eligible for finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities\n\nWithin the prescribed credit exposure norms and above stated restrictions, UCBs, with working capital funds aggregating to \u20b925 crores and above, may finance the NBFC - Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICC), subject to the following limits:\n\n\n#### Note\n\n(i) The maximum limit on bank finance should be within the overall ceiling of borrowing by NBFCs, upto ten times of their NOF.\n\n(ii) Bank finance to leasing concerns should be restricted only to \"full payout\" leases i.e., those leases where the cost of the asset is fully recovered during the primary lease period itself and further it should cover purchases of only new equipment.\n\n(iii) As a prudent policy, lease rentals due during the period of next five years should alone be taken into account for the purpose of lending.\n\n6.8.3 Activities not Eligible for Finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities\n\n6.8.3.1 The following activities undertaken by non-banking financial companies engaged in hire purchase / leasing activities are not eligible for bank credit. As such, these items should be excluded from the build-up of current assets while arriving at permissible bank finance for all categories of NBFCs :\n\n(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except where specifically permitted;\n\n(ii) Investments made in shares, debentures etc. of a current nature, i.e., stockin-trade;\n\n(iii) Investment in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other entities; and,\n\n(iv) Investments in and inter-corporate loans / deposits to other companies.\n\n6.8.3.2 In respect of items indicated at (a) and (b) above, banks should not make any adjustment in the projected net working capital (NWC). It may be added that the projected NWC represents long-term surplus available to support current operations and, therefore, does not need to be adjusted as a result of changing / pruning the level of current assets while reducing the level of maximum permissible bank finance.\n\n6.8.4 Financing of NBFCs by Scheduled UCBs\n\n6.8.4.1 Scheduled UCBs may rediscount bills discounted by NBFCs arising from sale of commercial vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to normal lending safeguards and the following conditions:\n\n(i) the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturers on dealers only;\n\n(ii) the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from the chassis / engine numbers; and,\n\n(iii) before rediscounting the bills, the UCBs should satisfy themselves about the bona- fides and track record of NBFCs which have discounted the bills.\n\n6.8.4.2 Scheduled UCBs may provide finance to NBFCs eligible for bank finance for the purpose of on lending to Small Road and Water Transport Operators (SRWTOs) for purchase of trucks and classify such advances under priority sector, provided the ultimate borrowers (SRWTOs) satisfy the eligibility requirements for being classified under the priority sector.\n\n6.8.4.3 UCBs may finance NBFCs for on-lending to individual farmers and for hire purchase schemes for distribution of agricultural machinery and implements and the same may be reckoned for the purpose of priority sector lending as indirect finance to agriculture.\n\n6.8.4.4 The Scheduled UCBs may extend finance to NBFCs or other financial intermediaries for on-lending to small and micro enterprises (manufacturing as well as service) and classify such finance under priority sector after satisfying that relevant norms at the ultimate borrowal level are complied with.\n\n<span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>6.9 Financing Equipment Leasing and Hire Purchase Financing\n\nConsequent to the Government of India notification dated December 12, 1995 specifying 'Hire Purchase' and 'Equipment Leasing' as forms of business in which it is lawful for a primary cooperative bank to engage, Scheduled UCBs are allowed to",

Proof in this regard may be called for only in cases where banks have reason to doubt the borrowers' declaration. Even where a proof is required, it is not necessary to insist on a certificate from the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner; production of a receipt evidencing the payment of the dues or a certificate from the auditors of the borrower or any other similar proof may be considered sufficient.

As you are aware, the Master Direction - [Classification, Valuation and Operation of](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12534)  [Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks \\(Directions\\), 2023 dated September 12,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12534)  [2023](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12534) (hereinafter referred as 'MD on Investment') *inter alia* provides a clearly identifiable trading book under 'Held for Trading (HFT)' accounting sub-classification and introduces AFS-reserve which would be part of regulatory capital. In view of the changes cited above, it has been decided to amend the capital adequacy guidelines in alignment with the MD on Investment.\n\n3. Accordingly, the provisions of Master Circular \u2013 [Basel III Capital Regulations](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12504) have been modified as provided in [Annex 1.](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/CapitalAdequacy28022024_Annex1.pdf)\n\n4.

While the revised definition of trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will be as provided in Annex I of MD on Investment, the final guidelines on 'Market Risk Capital Requirements \u2013 Simplified Standardised Approach' will be implemented at a later date and detailed guidelines will be issued separately.\n\n5. Considering the transition to 'Market Risk Capital Requirements \u2013 Simplified Standardised Approach', the extant market risk capital requirements have also been recalibrated by introducing intermediate scalers. Banks should keep this in view while reviewing their strategies and capital planning measures.\n\n6. Further, the provisions of Master Direction \u2013 [Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12182)  [for Local Area Banks \\(Directions\\), 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12182) have been modified as provided in [Annex 2.](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/CapitalAdequacy28022024_Annex2.pdf)\n\n## **Applicability**\n\n7.

The choice of network for a card issued to a customer is decided by the card issuer (bank / nonbank) and is linked to the arrangements that the card issuers have with card networks in terms of their bilateral agreements.\n\n2. On a review, it is observed that some arrangements existing between card networks and card issuers are not conducive to the availability of choice for customers.\n\n3. In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007), the RBI being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient, in the interest of payment system and public interest, to do so, hereby, directs as under:\n\n- a) Card issuers shall not enter into any arrangement or agreement with card networks that restrain them from availing the services of other card networks.\n- b) Card issuers shall provide an option to their eligible customers to choose from multiple card networks at the time of issue. For existing cardholders, this option may be provided at the time of the next renewal.\n\nFor the purpose of these directions, the following definitions are used:\n\ni) Authorised card networks: American Express Banking Corp., Diners Club International Ltd., MasterCard Asia/ Pacific Pte.

Currently, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Immediate Payments Service (IMPS) systems enable a remitter to verify the name of the beneficiary before initiating transfer. It has been decided to put in place a similar facility that would enable a remitter to verify the beneficiary bank account name before initiating a transaction using RTGS or NEFT system. Accordingly, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has been advised to develop the facility and onboard all banks.\n\n3. Banks which are participants of RTGS and NEFT Systems, shall make this facility available to their customers through Internet banking and Mobile banking. The facility shall also be available to remitters visiting branches for making transactions. Detailed requirements for the same are provided in the **[Annex](#page-2-0)**.\n\n4. All banks who are direct members or sub members of RTGS and NEFT are advised to offer this facility no later than April 1, 2025.\n\n5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sudhanshu Prasad) Chief General Manager\n\n## **Annex**\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>(CO.DPSS.RPPD.No.S987/04.03.001/2024-25 dated December 30, 2024)\n\n## **Introduction of beneficiary bank account name look-up facility for Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) Systems**\n\n- 1. To ensure that remitters using RTGS and NEFT systems can verify the name of the bank account to which money is being transferred before initiating the transfer and thereby avoid mistakes and prevent frauds, a solution for fetching the beneficiary's name is being implemented. Based on the account number and IFSC of the beneficiary entered by the remitter, the facility will fetch the beneficiary's account name from the bank's Core Banking Solution (CBS).\n- 2. This facility shall be made available to remitters through Internet banking and Mobile banking. The facility shall also be available to remitters visiting branches for making transactions.\n- 3. To ensure uniform experience for customers, the banks shall adhere to the instructions given below:\n\t- i. Provision to verify beneficiary bank account name shall be provided in Internet banking and Mobile banking facilities at the time of registering a beneficiary and at the time of one-time fund transfer where the beneficiary may not be registered.\n\t- ii. Provision to re-verify a registered beneficiary at any time shall also be provided.\n\t- iii. Beneficiary account name provided by the beneficiary bank shall be displayed to the remitter.\n\t- iv. In case the beneficiary name cannot be displayed for any reason, the remitter can proceed with the fund transfer, at her discretion.\n\t- v. Specific alert messages as provided in the technical document, issued earlier by NPCI, shall be displayed to the remitter.\n- 4. Both remitting and beneficiary banks shall preserve detailed logs of all queries made, responses received and all other activities as part of beneficiary bank account name lookup facility.\n- 5. NPCI shall not store any data relating to this facility. In case of a dispute, the remitting bank and the beneficiary bank shall resolve the dispute based on the unique lookup reference number and the corresponding logs.\n- 6. While providing the facility, banks shall ensure to comply with legal provisions related to data privacy, if any.\n- 7. Beneficiary account name lookup facility shall be made available to customers without any charge.\n- 8. All banks who are direct members or sub members of RTGS and NEFT are advised to offer this facility no later than April 1, 2025.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",

Further, in terms of Section 11 (2) of FEMA, 1999, the Reserve Bank may, for the purpose of ensuring the compliance with the provisions of the Act or of any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order made thereunder, direct any authorized person to furnish such information, in such manner, as it deems fit. Authorised Dealers are therefore, advised to take necessary steps to ensure that checks and balances are incorporated in systems relating to dealing with and reporting of foreign exchange transactions so that contraventions of provisions of FEMA, 1999, attributable to the Authorised Dealers do not occur. In this connection, it is reiterated that in terms of Section 11(3) of FEMA, 1999, the Reserve Bank may impose on the authorized person a penalty for contravening any direction given by the Reserve Bank under this Act or failing to file any return as directed by the Reserve Bank.\n\n4.

It may, however, be noted that the guidance note is meant only for the purpose of broadly indicating the basis on which the compounding amount is derived by the compounding authorities in the Reserve Bank. The actual compounding amount payable may sometimes vary, depending on the circumstances of the case considering the factors indicated in the foregoing paragraph.\n\nI. Guidance Note on Computation Matrix\n\n\n\n\n**II.** The above amounts are presently subject to the following provisos, viz.\n\n- i. The compounding amount payable shall not exceed 300% of the sum involved in contravention.\n- ii. In case the sum involved in contravention is less than Rupees one lakh, the total compounding amount payable shall not be more than amount of simple interest @5% p.a. calculated on the sum involved in contravention and for the period of contravention in case of reporting contraventions and @10% p.a. in respect of all other contraventions.\n- iii. In case of paragraph 8 of Schedule I to FEMA 20/2000 RB contraventions, the compounding amount payable will be further graded as under:\n\t- a. If the shares are allotted after 180 days without the prior approval of Reserve Bank, 1.25 times the amount calculated as per table above (subject to provisos at (i) & (ii) above).\n\t- b. If the shares are not allotted and the amount is refunded after 180 days with the Bank's permission: 1.50 times the amount calculated as per table above (subject to provisos at (i) & (ii) above).\n\t- c. If the shares are not allotted and the amount is refunded after 180 days without the Bank's permission: 1.75 times the amount calculated as per table above (subject to provisos at (i) & (ii) above).\n- iv. In cases where it is established that the contravener has made undue gains, the\n\namount thereof may be neutralized to a reasonable extent by adding the same to the compounding amount calculated as per matrix above.\n\nv. If an applicant against whom a compounding order had been passed earlier and applicant didn't pay the compounding amount as mentioned in such order and reapplies for compounding of contravention relating to the same transaction, the amount calculated as above may be enhanced by 50% of earlier compounding amount subject to sub-para (i) above.\n\nIII. For calculating compounding amount in respect of reporting contraventions under para I.1 of above matrix, the period of contravention may be considered proportionately {(approx. rounded off to next higher month \u00f7 12) X amount for 1 year}. The total no. of days does not exclude Sundays/holidays.\n\n#### **6. Issue of the Compounding Order**\n\n**6.1** The Compounding Authority shall pass a compounding order after affording an opportunity of being heard to the applicant as expeditiously as possible and not later than 180 days from the date of receipt of such compounding application by Reserve Bank and complete in all respects, on the basis of the averments made in the application as well as other documents and submissions made in this context by the contravener during the personal hearings.\n\n**6.2** If the applicant opts for the personal hearing, the Reserve Bank would encourage the applicant to appear either personally or through a virtual mode rather than being represented / accompanied by legal experts / consultants, as compounding is a voluntary process and only for admitted contraventions. Appearing for or opting out of personal hearing does not have any bearing whatsoever on the compounding amount that may be specified in the compounding order. If the applicant does not opt for personal hearing or absents on the day of hearing, Compounding Authority may pass the order based on available information/ documents.\n\n**6.3** The Compounding Order shall specify the provisions of the FEMA, 1999 or any rule, regulation, notification, direction, or order issued in exercise of the powers under FEMA, 1999 in respect of which contravention has taken place along with details of the contravention.\n\n12\n\n**6.4** One copy of the compounding order shall be provided to the applicant and another copy shall also be provided to the Adjudicating Authority, where the compounding of any contravention is made after making of a complaint under sub- section (3) of section 16 of the FEMA, as the case may be.\n\n**6.5** The summary information about the compounding orders passed on or after March 01, 2020, shall be hosted on the Reserve Bank's website [\\(www.rbi.org.in\\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/) in the following format:\n\n\n## **7. Payment of the amount for which contravention is compounded.**\n\n**7.1** The compounding amount as specified in the compounding order shall be paid by way of demand draft in favour of the \"Reserve Bank ofIndia\" or National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT), or Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), or such other permissible electronic or online modes of payment within 15 days from the date of the order of compounding of such contraven",

It requires banks, among other things, to undertake an annual review of accounts/ deposits where there are no customer induced transactions for more than a year; segregation in their Core Banking Solution of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and/ or Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)/ Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) under Government Schemes to facilitate credit of DBTs even if such accounts have become inoperative; and take steps to trace the customers of these accounts/ deposits. It also contains operational guidelines for activation of such accounts/ deposits, customer awareness measures such as public awareness and financial literacy campaigns to be undertaken by banks and requires information on the process for activation of such accounts/ deposits to be displayed on the banks' websites and branches.\n\n2. The Department of Supervision, RBI, recently conducted an analysis, which revealed that the number of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits in several banks was on the higher side vis-a-vis their total deposits as well as in absolute terms. The reasons were attributed to either inactivity for a long time or pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC in such accounts. Reportedly, there were instances of customers facing inconvenience when they approached the bank branches for activation of inoperative accounts including inadvertent errors in customer details such as mismatch in name, etc. It was also observed that a few banks have a large pendency of accounts that are due for updation/ periodic updation of KYC, resulting in such accounts getting frozen for further transactions as per bank's internal policies.\n\n> \u092a\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947 \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u092e\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u091f\u093e\u0935\u0930 - \u090f\u092b\u093c, \u0915\u092b \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0921, \u0915\u094b\u0932\u093e\u092c\u093e, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 005 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928: 022 - 6997 3817 \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932: [ppgdos@rbi.org.in](mailto:ppgdos@rbi.org.in)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n3. The banks are, therefore, advised to take necessary steps urgently to bring down the number of inoperative/ frozen accounts and make the process of activation of such accounts smoother and hassle free, including by enabling seamless updation of KYC through mobile/internet banking, non-home branches, Video Customer Identification Process, etc. While the accounts of beneficiaries of various Central/ State government schemes like DBT/EBT etc., are required to be segregated to facilitate uninterrupted credit of such DBT/EBT amounts in their accounts, instances have been observed where the accounts of such beneficiaries have been frozen due to other factors such as pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC. Since these accounts mostly pertain to the people from the underprivileged sections of the society, the banks may facilitate the process of activation of accounts by taking an empathetic view in such cases. The banks may also organise special campaigns for facilitating activation of inoperative/ frozen accounts. Besides, the banks may also facilitate Aadhaar updation for customers through the branches providing Aadhaar related services. Instructions have been issued separately to SLBCs to proactively monitor the situation in their respective jurisdictions with a view to minimise customer inconvenience.\n\n4. The progress in reduction of inoperative/ frozen accounts and the special efforts made by the banks in this regard, may be monitored by the Customer Service Committee (CSC) of the Board. In addition, the banks are also advised to report the same on a quarterly basis to the respective Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM) through DAKSH portal, starting from the quarter ending December 31, 2024.\n\n5. A copy of this Circular shall also be placed before the CSC of the Board in its next meeting along with a monitorable action plan for ensuring full compliance in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh) Chief General Manager",

General**\n\n1.1 The role of primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) in providing housing finance has been reviewed from time to time. These banks, with their vast network, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an important role to play in providing credit to the housing sector. Further, housing finance to specified categories up to prescribed limits is treated as priority sector lending, and the need for UCBs providing credit to priority sector has come to be increasingly recognised consistent with the social objectives placed before the banking system.\n\n1.2 Therefore, with a view to enabling the UCBs to play a more positive role in providing finance for housing schemes, particularly to the weaker sections of the community, these banks are permitted to grant loans for housing schemes up to certain limits from their own resources subject to the guidelines detailed hereunder.\n\n1.3 Bigger banks that have large surplus resources may undertake larger lending for housing, as this will provide a remunerative avenue for investment of their surplus funds.\n\n1.4 Wherever banks are still required to obtain special permission of the Registrar for financing housing societies, it is suggested that these banks should obtain general permission to finance housing societies subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed for the purpose.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-2-1\"></span>**2. Eligible Category of Borrowers**\n\nUCBs may grant loans to the following categories of borrowers:\n\n- (a) Individuals and co-operative / group housing societies.\n- (b) Housing boards undertaking housing projects or schemes for economically weaker sections (EWS), low income groups (LIG) and middle income groups (MIG).\n- (c) Owners of houses / flats for extension and up-gradation, including major repairs.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-2-2\"></span>**3. Eligibility for Housing Finance**\n\nThe borrowers in the above categories will be eligible for finance for the following purposes:\n\n- (a) Construction / purchase of houses / flats by individuals\n- (b) Repairs, alterations and additions to houses / flats by individuals\n- (c) Schemes for housing and hostels for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes\n- (d) Under slum clearance schemes directly to the slum dwellers on the guarantee of the Government, or indirectly through Statutory Boards established for this purpose\n- (e) Education, health, social, cultural or other institutions / centres which are part of a housing project and considered necessary for the development of settlements or townships\n\n(f) Shopping centres, markets and such other centres catering to the day to day needs of the residents of the housing colonies and forming part of a housing project\n\n# <span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>**4. Terms and Conditions for Housing Loans**\n\nFinance provided by the UCBs to the eligible categories of borrowers shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n\n# <span id=\"page-3-1\"></span>**4.1 Maximum Loan Amount & Margins**\n\n(i) UCBs, based on their commercial judgment and other prudential business considerations, with the approval of their Board of Directors, are free to identify the eligible borrowers, decide margins and grant housing loans depending upon the repaying capacity of borrowers.\n\n(ii) Tier-1 UCBs[1](#page-3-3) are permitted to extend individual housing loans upto a maximum of \u20b960 lakh per individual borrower and UCBs categorized in Tier-2 to 4 can extend individual housing loans up to a maximum of \u20b9140 lakh per individual borrower subject to extant prudential exposure limits.\n\n(iii) The pru",

While the purpose of the loan shall determine whether the loans granted against the security of immovable property need to be classified as real estate loans, the source of repayment will determine whether the exposure is against commercial real estate. For classification of such loans as Real Estate / Commercial Real Estate, UCBs may be guided by the instructions contained in [Annex 1.](#page-10-0) As loans to the residential housing projects under the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Sector exhibit lesser risk and volatility than the CRE Sector taken as a whole, a separate sub-sector called 'Commercial Real Estate\u2013 Residential Housing' (CRE-RH) has been carved out from the CRE Sector. CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption) under CRE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate. However, integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, etc.) can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.\n\n4.7.6 UCBs shall not exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real estate, commercial real estate loans even for the funds obtained from higher financing agencies and refinance from National Housing Bank.\n\n# <span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>**5.

Lending to Housing Boards**\n\n6.1 UCBs may extend loans to housing boards within their States. The rate of interest to be charged on the loans to such boards may be fixed at the discretion of the banks.\n\n6.2 While extending loans to housing boards, banks may not only keep in view the past performance of the housing boards in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but should also stipulate that the boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan instalments from the beneficiaries.\n\n# <span id=\"page-6-2\"></span>**7. Advances to Builders / Contractors**\n\n7.1 Builders / contractors generally require huge funds, take advance payments from the prospective buyers or from those on whose behalf construction is undertaken and, therefore, may not normally require bank finance for the purpose. Any financial assistance extended to them by UCBs may result in dual financing. Banks should, therefore, normally refrain from sanctioning loans and advances to this category of borrowers.\n\n7.2 However, where contractors undertake comparatively small construction work on their own, (i.e., when no advance payments are received by them for the purpose), banks may consider extending financial assistance to them against the hypothecation of construction materials, provided such loans and advances are in accordance with the bye laws of the bank and instructions / directives issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\n\n7.3 Banks should undertake a proper scrutiny of the relevant loan applications, and satisfy themselves, among other things, about the genuineness of the purpose, the quantum of financial assistance required, creditworthiness of the borrower, repayment capacity, etc. and also observe the usual safeguards, such as, obtaining periodic stock statements, carrying out periodic inspections, determining drawing power strictly on the basis of the stock held, maintaining a margin of not less than 40 to 50 percent, etc. They should also ensure that materials used up in the construction work are not included in the stock statements for the purpose of determining the drawing power.\n\n**7.4 Valuation of land:** It has been observed that while financing builders / contractors, certain banks valued the land for the purpose of security, on the basis of the discounted value of the property after it is developed, less the cost of development. This is not in conformity with established norms. In this connection, it is clarified that UCBs should not extend fund based / non-fund based facilities to builders / contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a housing project. Further, wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.\n\n7.5 UCBs may also take collateral security, wherever available. As construction work progresses, contractors will get paid and such payments should be applied to reduce the balance in the borrowal accounts. If possible, banks could perhaps enter into a tripartite agreement with the borrower and his clients, particularly when no collateral securities are available for such advances.\n\n7.6 It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing Loan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g., upfront disbursal of sanctioned individual housing loans to builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of construction of housing project, interest / EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period / specified period, etc. In view of the higher risks associated with such lump-sum disbursal of sanctioned housing loans and customer suitability issues, UCBs are advised that disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under-construction / green field housing projects.\n\n## <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>**8.

Income-producing real estate (IPRE) is defined in para 226 of the Basel II Framework as under:\n\n\"Income-producing real estate (IPRE) refers to a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The borrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPE (Special Purpose Entity), an operating company focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with sources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus other corporate exposures that are collateralised by real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment of the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on the cash flows generated by a property\".\n\n2. The Income Producing Real Estate (IPRE) is synonymous with Commercial Real Estate (CRE). From the definition of IPRE given above, it may be seen that for an exposure to be classified as IPRE / CRE, the essential feature would be that the funding will result in the creation / acquisition of real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, ",

Additionally, the prospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows generated from such funded asset which is taken as security, as would generally be the case. The primary source of cash flow (i.e., more than 50% of cash flows) for repayment would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as also for recovery in the event of default where such asset is taken as security.\n\n3. In certain cases where the exposure may not be directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by CRE. For example, exposures taken against existing commercial real estate whose prospects of repayments primarily depend on rental / sale proceeds of the real estate should be classified as CRE. Other such cases may include extension of guarantees on behalf of companies engaged in commercial real estate activities, corporate loans extended to real estate companies etc.\n\n4. It follows from the definition at para 2 and 3 above that if the repayment primarily depends on other factors such as operating profit from business operations, quality of goods and services, tourist arrivals etc., the exposure would not be counted as Commercial Real Estate.\n\n5. UCBs should not extend finance for acquisition of land even if it is part of a project. However, finance can be granted to individuals for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is obtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, within such period as may be laid down by the banks themselves.\n\n# **Simultaneous Classification of CRE into other Regulatory Categories**\n\n6. It is possible for an exposure to get classified simultaneously into more than one category, real estate, CRE, infrastructure etc. as different classifications are driven by different considerations. In such cases, the exposure would be reckoned for regulatory / prudential exposure limit, if any, fixed by RBI or by the bank itself, for all the categories to which the exposure is assigned. For the purpose of capital adequacy, the largest of the risk weights applicable among all the categories would be applicable for the exposure. The rationale for such an approach is that, while at times certain classifications / categorizations could be driven by socio-economic considerations and may be aimed at encouraging flow of credit towards certain activities, these exposures should be subjected to appropriate risk management / prudential / capital adequacy norms so as to address the risk inherent in them. Similarly, if an exposure has sensitivity to more than one risk factor it should be subjected to the risk management framework applicable to all the relevant risk factors.\n\n7. In order to assist banks in determining as to whether a particular exposure should be classified as CRE or not, some examples based on the principles described above are given below. Based on the above principles and illustrations given, banks should be able to determine, whether an exposure not included in the illustrative examples is a CRE or not and should record a reasoned note justifying the classification.\n\n# **Illustrative Examples**\n\n## **A. Exposures which should be classified as CRE**\n\n1. Loans extended to builders for construction of any property which is intended to be sold or given on lease (e.g., loans extended to builders for housing buildings, hotels, restaurants, gymnasiums, hospitals, condominiums, shopping malls, office blocks, theatres, amusement parks, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, industrial parks). In such cases, the source of repayment in normal course would be the cash flows generated by the sale / lease rentals of the property. In case of default of the loan, the recovery will also be made from sale of the property if the exposure is secured by these assets as would generally be the case.\n\n#### 2. Loans for Multiple Houses intended to be rented out\n\nThe housing loans extended in cases where houses are rented out need to be treated differently. If the total number of such units is more than two, the exposure for the third unit onwards may be treated as CRE exposure as the borrower may be renting these housing units and the rental income would be the primary source of repayment.\n\n#### 3. Loans for Integrated Township Projects\n\nWhere the CRE is part of a big project which has small non-CRE component, it will be classified as CRE exposure since the primary source of repayment for such exposures would be the sale proceeds of buildings meant for sale.\n\n4. Exposures to Real Estate Companies\n\nIn some cases, exposure to real estate companies is not directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by Commercial Real Estate.

General Purpose loans where repayment is dependent on real estate prices\n\nExposures intended to be repaid out of rentals / sale proceeds generated by the existing CRE owned by the borrower, where the finance may have been extended for a general purpose.\n\n#### **B. Exposures which may not be classified as CRE**\n\n1. Exposures to entrepreneurs for acquiring real estate for the purpose of their carrying on business activities, which would be serviced out of the cash flows generated by those business activities. The exposure could be secured by the real estate where the activity is carried out, as would generally be the case, or could even be unsecured.\n\na. Loans extended for construction of a cinema theatre, establishment of an amusement park, hotels and hospitals, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, running haircutting saloons and beauty parlours, restaurant, gymnasium etc. to those entrepreneurs who themselves run these ventures would fall in this category. Such loans would generally be secured by these properties.\n\nFor instance, in the case of hotels and hospitals, the source of repayment in normal course would be the cash flows generated by the services rendered by the hotel and hospital. In the case of a hotel, the cash flows would be mainly sensitive to the factors influencing the flow of tourism, not directly to the fluctuations in the real estate prices. In the case of a hospital, the cash flows in normal course would be sensitive to the quality of doctors and other diagnostic services provided by the hospital. In these cases, the source of repayment might also depend to some extent upon the real estate prices to the extent the fluctuation in prices influence the room rents, but it will be a minor factor in determining the overall cash flows. In these cases, however, the recovery in case of default, if the exposure is secured by the Commercial Real Estate, would depend upon the sale price of the hotel / hospital as well as upon the maintenance and quality of equipment and furnishings.\n\nThe above principle will also be applicable in the cases where the developers / owners of the real estate assets (hotels, hospitals, warehouses, etc.) lease out the assets on revenue sharing or profit sharing arrangement and the repayment of exposure depends upon the cash flows generated by the services rendered, instead of fixed lease rentals.\n\nb. Loans extended to entrepreneurs, for setting up industrial units will also fall in this category. In such cases, the repayment would be made from the cash flows generated by the industrial unit from sale of the material produced which would mainly depend upon demand and supply factors. The recovery in case of default may partly depend upon the sale of land and building if secured by these assets.\n\nThus, it may be seen that in these cases the real estate prices do not affect repayment though recovery of the loan could partly be from sale of real estate.\n\n2. Loans extended to a company for a specific purpose, not linked to a real estate activity, which is engaged in mixed activities including real estate activity.\n\nFor instance, a company has two divisions. One division is engaged in real estate activity, and other division is engaged in power production. An infrastructure loan, for setting up of a power plant extended to such a company, to be repaid by the sale of electricity would not be classified as CRE. The exposure may or may not be secured by plant and machinery.\n\n3. Loans extended against the Security of future rent receivables\n\nA few banks have formulated schemes where the owners of existing real estate such as shopping malls, office premises, etc. have been offered finance to be repaid out of the rentals generated by these properties. Even though such exposures do not result in funding / acquisition of commercial real estate, the repayment might be sensitive to fall in real estate rentals and such exposures should be classified as CRE. However, if there are certain in built safety conditions which have the effect of delinking the repayments from real estate price volatility like, the lease rental agreement between the lessor and lessee has a lock in period which is not shorter than the tenor of loan and there is no clause which allows a downward revision in the rentals during the period covered by the loan banks can classify such exposures as non CRE. Banks may, however, record a reasoned note in all such cases.\n\n4. Credit facilities provided to construction companies which work as Contractors\n\nThe working capital facilities extended to construction companies working as contractors, rather than builders, will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment would depend upon the contractual payments received in accordance with the progress in comp",

Introduction**\n\nReserve Bank of India has been regulating the financial activities of the Non-Banking Financial Companies under the provisions of Chapter III B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. With the amendment of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 in January 1997, in terms of Section 45 IA of the said Act, and amendment of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 in August 2019, in terms of Section 29 A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, all Non-Banking Financial Companies including Housing Finance Companies have to be mandatorily registered with the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n#### **1.1 Terminology**\n\n- a. 'NBFCs' means the Non-Banking Financial Companies registered with the Reserve Bank of India, which shall also include Housing Finance Company (HFC) registered under Section 29 A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987.\n- b. 'Current investments' means the investments classified in the balance sheet of the borrower as 'current assets' and are intended to be held for less than one year.\n- c. 'Long term investments' means all types of investments other than that classified as 'current assets'.\n- d. 'Unsecured loans' means the loans not secured by any tangible asset.\n\n#### **1.2 Background**\n\nThe credit related matters of banks have been progressively deregulated by Reserve Bank of India. Consistent with the policy of bestowing greater operational freedom to banks in the matter of credit dispensation and in the context of mandatory registration of NBFCs with the Reserve Bank, most of the aspects relating to financing of NBFCs by banks have also been deregulated. However, in view of the sensitivities attached to financing of certain types of activities undertaken by NBFCs, restrictions on financing of such activities continue to be in force.\n\n#### **2. Bank Finance to NBFCs registered with RBI**\n\n2.1 The ceiling on bank credit linked to Net Owned Fund (NOF) of NBFCs has been withdrawn in respect of all NBFCs which are statutorily registered with RBI and are engaged in principal business of asset financing, loan, factoring and investment activities. Accordingly, banks may extend need based working capital facilities as well as term loans to all NBFCs registered with RBI and engaged in infrastructure financing, equipment leasing, hire-purchase, loan, factoring and investment activities subject to provisions of para 8 of these guidelines.\n\n2.2 In the light of the experience gained by NBFCs in financing second hand assets, banks may also extend finance to NBFCs against second hand assets financed by them.\n\n2.3 Banks may formulate suitable loan policy with the approval of their Boards of Directo",

On investigation, it has been observed that to facilitate unauthorised forex trading, these entities have taken recourse to engaging local agents who open accounts at different bank branches for collecting money towards margin, investment, charges, etc. These accounts are opened in the name of individuals, proprietary concerns, trading firms etc. and the transactions in such accounts are not found to be commensurate with the stated purpose for opening the account in several cases. It is also observed that these entities are providing options to residents to remit/deposit funds in Rupees for undertaking unauthorised forex transactions using domestic payment systems like online transfers, payment gateways, etc.\n\n2.

In this context, reference is also invited to ['Accessibility Standards and Guidelines for Banking Sector'](https://financialservices.gov.in/beta/sites/default/files/2024-08/Guidelines-for-Banking-Sector.pdf) as notified by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India on February 02, 2024.\n\n2. All sections of population, including differently abled persons, are increasingly adopting digital payment systems. To promote effective access, payment system participants (PSPs, that is, banks and authorised non-bank payment system providers) are advised to review their payment systems / devices in terms of accessibility to Persons with Disabilities. Based on the review they may carry out the necessary modifications, such that all their payment systems and devices, such as Point-of-Sale machines, can be accessed and used by Persons with Disabilities with ease. In this connection, the Accessibility Standards issued by the Ministry of Finance referred to above may also be adhered to, as applicable, by all PSPs. While selecting potential solutions for the purpose, care should be taken to ensure that the modifications / enhancements do not compromise security aspects of their systems.\n\n3. PSPs shall submit to the Reserve Bank, within one month of the date of issue of this circular, details of their systems / devices that need to be modified, along with a time bound plan of action for achieving the same. The action plan may be sent to the Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve Bank of India at [dpssfeedback@rbi.org.in](mailto:dpssfeedback@rbi.org.in) along with details of a Nodal Officer who could be contacted, if required, for further queries / clarifications.\n\n4. This directive is issued under Section 18 read with Section 10 (2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Gunveer Singh) Chief General Manager-in-Charge",

There should be two accounts: one for funds received from lenders pending disbursal and another for collections from borrowers. Funds from the lenders' escrow account can only be disbursed to the borrower's bank account after compliance with paragraph 8(3) of the directions is ensured, and repayment funds from borrowers must be transferred from the borrower's account to the borrowers' escrow account and then to the respective lender's bank account. Funds from the 'Lenders' Escrow Account' cannot be used for loan repayment, and funds from the 'Borrowers' Escrow Account' cannot be used for loan disbursement. Additionally, funds in the Escrow Accounts cannot remain there for more than 'T+1' day, where 'T' is the date the funds were received.",

Cir No. 9/12.05.001/2019-20 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0)  [January 6, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0) on the Supervisory Action Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs).\n\n2. The existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) for UCBs has since been reviewed. Accordingly, the revised framework replacing the SAF, under the nomenclature Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework is contained in the enclosed [Annex.](#page-2-0)\n\n3. The PCA Framework shall be applicable to all UCBs under Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories except UCBs under All Inclusive Directions[1.](#page-0-0) Tier 1 UCBs, though not covered under the PCA Framework as of now, shall be subject to enhanced monitoring under the extant supervisory framework. The exemption of Tier 1 UCBs from the PCA Framework shall be reviewed in due course.\n\n4. The objective of the PCA Framework is to enable supervisory intervention at an appropriate time and require the UCBs to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, to restore their financial health. The PCA Framework does not\n\n<span id=\"page-0-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID) shall continue to be monitored as hitherto including with respect to the conditions under AID.

The provisions of the PCA Framework will be effective from April 1, 2025.\n\n6. UCBs which are currently subject to supervisory actions on the basis of [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0)  [DOR \\(PCB\\).BPD. Cir No. 9/12.05.001/2019-20 dated January 6, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0) referred above will continue to be governed by the restrictions imposed on them. Such UCBs will be considered for an exit from SAF or to be placed under PCA on a case-by-case basis by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n7. A copy of this circular should be placed before the Board of Directors of your bank in its next meeting and a confirmation thereof should be sent to the office of the Senior Supervisory Manager concerned.\n\n8. With effect from April 1, 2025, instructions contained in this circular shall supersede all earlier instructions issued on SAF.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh) Chief General Manager\n\nEnclosure: PCA Framework for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>![](_page_2_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **PCA Framework for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks**\n\n- A. Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability will be the key areas for monitoring in the revised PCA Framework.\n- B. Indicators to be tracked for Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability would be CRAR, Net NPA Ratio (percentage of net NPA to net advances) and net profit, respectively.\n- C. The PCA Framework would apply to all Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4, based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators.\n- D. Breach of any risk threshold (as detailed under) may result in invocation of PCA.\n\n\n\\* For Tier 2 to 4 UCBs as per the glide path provided for achieving the regulatory minimum CRAR of 12% by March 31, 2026.\n\n<span id=\"page-2-1\"></span><sup>2</sup> Reserve Bank of India - [Press Releases \\(rbi.org.in\\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=54059)\n\n![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n- E. A bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Reported/Audited Annual Financial Results and/or the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. However, RBI may impose PCA on any bank during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant. Although supervisory action taken will primarily be based on the criteria specified under the PCA Framework, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking appropriate supervisory action in case stress is noticed in other important indicators/parameters or in case of serious governance issues. Also, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking any supervisory action other than those indicated in this circular, based on the merits of each case.\n- F.

It is observed that some UCBs have created the Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) through appropriation of profits, with an intent to utilise these balances to pay dividend in future years, when profits are not sufficient or where the bank has posted a net loss. However, extant guidelines on [\"Declaration of Dividends by UCBs\" dated July 05, 2012](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=7426&Mode=0) *ibid* prohibit dividend payments from previously accumulated profits or reserves and mandate that dividend can only be paid by the banks from net profit of the current year after making all statutory and other provisions and after adjustment for accumulated losses in full. It is also observed that UCBs have been considering the balances in DEF as part of Tier-II capital.\n\n3. In order to provide a better treatment of these balances for regulatory capital purposes, it has been decided, as a onetime measure, to permit UCBs to transfer the balances in the DEF to general reserves/free reserves. The credit balances in general reserves/free reserves, shall qualify as Tier-I capital as per our Master Circular *ibid.*\n\n> \u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917,\u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, 12 \u0935\ufffd \u0914\u0930 13 \u0935\ufffd \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932, \u0915\ufffd\ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d,\u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d,\u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908-400001 \u0926\u0942\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0937: 022-22601000 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938: 022-22705691 \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932: [cgmicdor@rbi.org.in](mailto:cgmicdor@rbi.org.in)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Department of Regulation, Central Office, 12th and 13th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai-400 001 Tel: 022- 2260 1000 Fax: 022-2270 5691 email[: cgmicdor@rbi.org.in](mailto:cgmicdor@rbi.org.in)\n\n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \ufffd\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093e\u0907\u090f\n\n4.
